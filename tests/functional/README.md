### Functional Testing

Functional testing is a type of black-box testing that verifies a software system against its functional requirements and specifications. It focuses on the input and expected output of a feature without considering its internal code structure. In your case, a functional test for `secureCache` would involve:

*   **Input**: Adding data to the cache, trying to retrieve it after a certain time or condition.
*   **Output**: Verifying that the data is retrieved correctly, or that it has been evicted as expected based on the algorithm used.

This type of testing ensures that each function of the software application works in conformance with the requirements.

### Other Relevant Testing Terms

Here are other types of testing and how they relate to your scenario:

*   **Black-Box Testing**: This is a testing method where the tester does not have knowledge of the internal workings of the software. Since your tests focus on inputs and outputs without knowing the internal implementation, functional testing is a type of black-box testing.
