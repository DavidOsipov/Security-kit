### Reimagining E2E for a Library

#### Sample Application Testing
This is the "E2E" equivalent for a library. Instead of testing a user journey on a UI, you would:
1.  Build a few small, sample applications using popular frameworks (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).
2.  Install and use your security kit in these applications as a developer would.
3.  Write tests that run against these sample apps to confirm that your library integrates and functions correctly within a realistic build and runtime environment.

*   **Why it's for you:** This can uncover issues that only appear when your library is used within a larger application, such as problems with build tools (Webpack, Vite), module resolution, or conflicts with framework lifecycles.

Your current testing strategy is already in the top tier. Adding these additional layers, especially around security and compatibility, would make your security kit exceptionally reliable and trustworthy for the developers who choose to use it.
