    Goals

The URL standard takes the following approach towards making URLs fully
interoperable:

  *

    Align RFC 3986 and RFC 3987 with contemporary implementations and
    obsolete the RFCs in the process. (E.g., spaces, other "illegal"
    code points, query encoding, equality, canonicalization, are all
    concepts not entirely shared, or defined.) URL parsing needs to
    become as solid as HTML parsing. [RFC3986] <#biblio-rfc3986>
    [RFC3987] <#biblio-rfc3987>

  *

    Standardize on the term URL. URI and IRI are just confusing. In
    practice a single algorithm is used for both so keeping them
    distinct is not helping anyone. URL also easily wins the search
    result popularity contest <https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?
    q=url,uri>.

  *

    Supplanting Origin of a URI [sic] <https://tools.ietf.org/html/
    rfc6454#section-4>. [RFC6454] <#biblio-rfc6454>

  *

    Define URL’s existing JavaScript API in full detail and add
    enhancements to make it easier to work with. Add a new |URL <#url>|
    object as well for URL manipulation without usage of HTML elements.
    (Useful for JavaScript worker environments.)

  *

    Ensure the combination of parser, serializer, and API guarantee
    idempotence. For example, a non-failure result of a parse-then-
    serialize operation will not change with any further parse-then-
    serialize operations applied to it. Similarly, manipulating a non-
    failure result through the API will not change from applying any
    number of serialize-then-parse operations to it.

As the editors learn more about the subject matter the goals might
increase in scope somewhat.


    1. Infrastructure<#infrastructure>

This specification depends on Infra. [INFRA] <#biblio-infra>

Some terms used in this specification are defined in the following
standards and specifications:

  * Encoding [ENCODING] <#biblio-encoding>
  * File API [FILEAPI] <#biblio-fileapi>
  * HTML [HTML] <#biblio-html>
  * Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>
  * Web IDL [WEBIDL] <#biblio-webidl> 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To serialize an integer, represent it as the shortest possible decimal
number.


      1.1. Writing<#writing>

A validation error indicates a mismatch between input and valid input.
User agents, especially conformance checkers, are encouraged to report
them somewhere.

A validation error <#validation-error> does not mean that the parser
terminates. Termination of a parser is always stated explicitly, e.g.,
through a return statement.

It is useful to signal validation errors <#validation-error> as error-
handling can be non-intuitive, legacy user agents might not implement
correct error-handling, and the intent of what is written might be
unclear to other developers.

Error type 	Error description 	Failure
IDNA <#idna>
domain-to-ASCII 	

Unicode ToASCII <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToASCII> records
an error or returns the empty string. [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>

If details about Unicode ToASCII <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/
#ToASCII> errors are recorded, user agents are encouraged to pass those
along.

	Yes
domain-invalid-code-point 	

The input’s host <#concept-host> contains a forbidden domain code point
<#forbidden-domain-code-point>.

<#example-domain-invalid-code-point>

Hosts are percent-decoded <#string-percent-decode> before being
processed when the URL is special <#is-special>, which would result in
the following host portion becoming "|exa#mple.org|" and thus triggering
this error.

"|https://exa%23mple.org|"

	Yes
domain-to-Unicode 	

Unicode ToUnicode <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToUnicode>
records an error. [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>

The same considerations as with domain-to-ASCII <#validation-error-
domain-to-ascii> apply.

	·
missing-scheme-non-relative-URL 	

The input is missing a scheme <#concept-url-scheme>, because it does not
begin with an ASCII alpha <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alpha>,
and either no base URL <#concept-base-url> was provided or the base URL
<#concept-base-url> cannot be used as a base URL <#concept-base-url>
because it has an opaque path <#url-opaque-path>.

	·


      1.2. Parsers<#parsers>

The EOF code point is a conceptual code point that signifies the end of
a string or code point stream.

A pointer for a string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string> input is
an integer that points to a code point <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#code-point> within input. Initially it points to the start of input. If
it is −1 it points nowhere. If it is greater than or equal to input’s
code point length <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-code-point-
length>, it points to the EOF code point <#eof-code-point>.

When a pointer <#pointer> is used, c references the code point <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-point> the pointer <#pointer> points to as
long as it does not point nowhere. When the pointer <#pointer> points to
nowhere c <#c> cannot be used.

When a pointer <#pointer> is used, remaining references the code point
substring <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-point-substring-to-the-
end-of-the-string> from the pointer <#pointer> + 1 to the end of the
string, as long as c <#c> is not the EOF code point <#eof-code-point>.
When c <#c> is the EOF code point <#eof-code-point> remaining
<#remaining> cannot be used.

<#example-12672b6a>If "|mailto:username@example|" is a string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string> being processed and a pointer <#pointer>
points to @, c <#c> is U+0040 (@) and remaining <#remaining> is "|
example|".

<#example-empty-string>If the empty string is being processed and a
pointer <#pointer> points to the start and is then decreased by 1, using
c <#c> or remaining <#remaining> would be an error.


      1.3. Percent-encoded bytes<#percent-encoded-bytes>

A percent-encoded byte is U+0025 (%), followed by two ASCII hex digits
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-hex-digit>.

It is generally a good idea for sequences of percent-encoded bytes
<#percent-encoded-byte> to be such that, when percent-decoded <#string-
percent-decode> and then passed to UTF-8 decode without BOM or fail
<https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-decode-without-bom-or-fail>,
they do not end up as failure. How important this is depends on where
the percent-encoded bytes <#percent-encoded-byte> are used. E.g., for
the host parser <#concept-host-parser> not following this advice is
fatal, whereas for URL rendering <#url-rendering-i18n> the percent-
encoded bytes <#percent-encoded-byte> would not be rendered percent-
decoded <#string-percent-decode>.

To percent-encode a byte <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#byte> byte,
return a string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string> consisting of
U+0025 (%), followed by two ASCII upper hex digits <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-upper-hex-digit> representing byte.

To percent-decode a byte sequence <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#byte-
sequence> input, run these steps:

Using anything but UTF-8 decode without BOM <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-decode-without-bom> when input contains
bytes that are not ASCII bytes <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-
byte> might be insecure and is not recommended.

 1.

    Let output be an empty byte sequence <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
    #byte-sequence>.

 2.

    For each byte byte in input:

     1.

        If byte is not 0x25 (%), then append byte to output.

     2.

        Otherwise, if byte is 0x25 (%) and the next two bytes after byte
        in input are not in the ranges 0x30 (0) to 0x39 (9), 0x41 (A) to
        0x46 (F), and 0x61 (a) to 0x66 (f), all inclusive, append byte
        to output.

     3.

        Otherwise:

         1.

            Let bytePoint be the two bytes after byte in input, decoded
            <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#isomorphic-decode>, and then
            interpreted as hexadecimal number.

         2.

            Append a byte whose value is bytePoint to output.

         3.

            Skip the next two bytes in input.

 3.

    Return output.

To percent-decode a scalar value string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#scalar-value-string> input:

 1.

    Let bytes be the UTF-8 encoding <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/
    #utf-8-encode> of input.

 2.

    Return the percent-decoding <#percent-decode> of bytes.

In general, percent-encoding results in a string with more U+0025 (%)
code points than the input, and percent-decoding results in a byte
sequence with less 0x25 (%) bytes than the input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The C0 control percent-encode set are the C0 controls <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#c0-control> and all code points <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-point> greater than U+007E (~).

The fragment percent-encode set is the C0 control percent-encode set
<#c0-control-percent-encode-set> and U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 ("), U+003C
(<), U+003E (>), and U+0060 (`).

The query percent-encode set is the C0 control percent-encode set <#c0-
control-percent-encode-set> and U+0020 SPACE, U+0022 ("), U+0023 (#),
U+003C (<), and U+003E (>).

The query percent-encode set <#query-percent-encode-set> cannot be
defined in terms of the fragment percent-encode set <#fragment-percent-
encode-set> due to the omission of U+0060 (`).

The special-query percent-encode set is the query percent-encode set
<#query-percent-encode-set> and U+0027 (').

The path percent-encode set is the query percent-encode set <#query-
percent-encode-set> and U+003F (?), U+005E (^), U+0060 (`), U+007B ({),
and U+007D (}).

The userinfo percent-encode set is the path percent-encode set <#path-
percent-encode-set> and U+002F (/), U+003A (:), U+003B (;), U+003D (=),
U+0040 (@), U+005B ([) to U+005D (]), inclusive, and U+007C (|).

The component percent-encode set is the userinfo percent-encode set
<#userinfo-percent-encode-set> and U+0024 ($) to U+0026 (&), inclusive,
U+002B (+), and U+002C (,).

This is used by HTML for |registerProtocolHandler() <https://
html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/system-state.html#dom-navigator-
registerprotocolhandler>|, and could also be used by other standards to
percent-encode data that can then be embedded in a URL <#concept-url>’s
path <#concept-url-path>, query <#concept-url-query>, or fragment
<#concept-url-fragment>; or in an opaque host <#opaque-host>. Using it
with UTF-8 percent-encode <#string-utf-8-percent-encode> gives identical
results to JavaScript’s |encodeURIComponent()| [sic] <https://tc39.es/
ecma262/#sec-encodeuricomponent-uricomponent>. [HTML] <#biblio-html>
[ECMA-262] <#biblio-ecma-262>

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode set is the
component percent-encode set <#component-percent-encode-set> and U+0021
(!), U+0027 (') to U+0029 RIGHT PARENTHESIS, inclusive, and U+007E (~).

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode set
<#application-x-www-form-urlencoded-percent-encode-set> contains all
code points, except the ASCII alphanumeric <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alphanumeric>, U+002A (*), U+002D (-),
U+002E (.), and U+005F (_).

To percent-encode after encoding, given an encoding <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding> encoding, scalar value string
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input, a
percentEncodeSet, and an optional boolean spaceAsPlus (default false):

 1.

    Let encoder be the result of getting an encoder <https://
    encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#get-an-encoder> from encoding.

    Let inputQueue be input converted to an I/O queue <https://
    encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-stream>.

 3.

    Let output be the empty string.

 4.

    Let potentialError be 0.

    This needs to be a non-null value to initiate the subsequent while
    loop.

 5.

    While potentialError is non-null:

     1.

        Let encodeOutput be an empty I/O queue <https://
        encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-stream>.

     2.

        Set potentialError to the result of running encode or fail
        <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encode-or-fail> with
        inputQueue, encoder, and encodeOutput.

     3.

        For each byte of encodeOutput converted to a byte sequence:

         1.

            If spaceAsPlus is true and byte is 0x20 (SP), then append
            U+002B (+) to output and continue <https://
            infra.spec.whatwg.org/#iteration-continue>.

         2.

            Let isomorph be a code point <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
            #code-point> whose value <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
            #code-point-value> is byte’s value <https://

            to output.

         5.

            the result to output.

     4.

        If potentialError is non-null, then append "|%26%23|", followed

        infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-digit> representing potentialError
        in base ten, followed by "|%3B|", to output.

        This can happen when encoding is not UTF-8 <https://
        encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>.

 6.

    Return output.

Of the possible values for the percentEncodeSet argument only two end up
encoding U+0025 (%) and thus give “roundtripable data”: component
percent-encode set <#component-percent-encode-set> and |application/x-
www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode set <#application-x-www-form-
urlencoded-percent-encode-set>. The other values for the
percentEncodeSet argument — which happen to be used by the URL parser
<#concept-url-parser> — leave U+0025 (%) untouched and as such it needs
to be percent-encoded <#utf-8-percent-encode> first in order to be
properly represented.

To UTF-8 percent-encode a scalar value <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#scalar-value> scalarValue using a percentEncodeSet, return the result
of running percent-encode after encoding <#string-percent-encode-after-
encoding> with UTF-8 <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>,
scalarValue as a string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string>, and
percentEncodeSet.

To UTF-8 percent-encode a scalar value string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input using a
percentEncodeSet, return the result of running percent-encode after
encoding <#string-percent-encode-after-encoding> with UTF-8 <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>, input, and percentEncodeSet.

    2. Security considerations<#security-considerations>

The security of a URL <#concept-url> is a function of its environment.
Care is to be taken when rendering, interpreting, and passing URLs
<#concept-url> around.

When rendering and allocating new URLs <#concept-url> "spoofing" needs
to be considered. An attack whereby one host <#concept-host> or URL
<#concept-url> can be confused for another. For instance, consider how
1/l/I, m/rn/rri, 0/O, and а/a can all appear eerily similar. Or worse,
consider how U+202A LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING and similar code points
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-point> are invisible. [UTR36]
<#biblio-utr36>

When passing a URL <#concept-url> from party A to B, both need to
carefully consider what is happening. A might end up leaking data it
does not want to leak. B might receive input it did not expect and take
an action that harms the user. In particular, B should never trust A, as
at some point URLs <#concept-url> from A can come from untrusted sources.


    3. Hosts (domains and IP addresses)<#hosts-(domains-and-ip-addresses)>

At a high level, a host <#concept-host>, valid host string <#valid-host-
string>, host parser <#concept-host-parser>, and host serializer
<#concept-host-serializer> relate as follows:

  *

    The host parser <#concept-host-parser> takes an arbitrary scalar
    value string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string>
    and returns either failure or a host <#concept-host>.

  *

    A host <#concept-host> can be seen as the in-memory representation.

  *

    A valid host string <#valid-host-string> defines what input would
    not trigger a validation error <#validation-error> or failure when
    given to the host parser <#concept-host-parser>. I.e., input that
    would be considered conforming or valid.

  *

    The host serializer <#concept-host-serializer> takes a host
    <#concept-host> and returns an ASCII string <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>. (If that string is then parsed
    <#concept-host-parser>, the result will equal <#concept-host-equals>
    the host <#concept-host> that was serialized <#concept-host-
    serializer>.)

<#example-host-parsing>

A parse <#concept-host-parser>-serialize <#concept-host-serializer>
roundtrip gives the following results, depending on the isOpaque
argument to the host parser <#concept-host-parser>:

Input 	Output (isOpaque = false) 	Output (isOpaque = true)
|EXAMPLE.COM| 	|example.com| (domain <#concept-domain>) 	|EXAMPLE.COM|
(opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|example%2Ecom| 	|example%2Ecom| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|faß.example| 	|xn--fa-hia.example| (domain <#concept-domain>) 	|
fa%C3%9F.example| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|0| 	|0.0.0.0| (IPv4 <#concept-ipv4>) 	|0| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|%30| 	|%30| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|0x| 	|0x| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|0xffffffff| 	|255.255.255.255| (IPv4 <#concept-ipv4>) 	|0xffffffff|
(opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|[0:0::1]| 	|[::1]| (IPv6 <#concept-ipv6>)
|[0:0::1%5D| 	Failure
|[0:0::%31]|
|09| 	Failure 	|09| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|example.255| 	|example.255| (opaque host <#opaque-host>)
|example^example| 	Failure


      3.1. Host representation<#host-representation>

A host is a domain <#concept-domain>, an IP address <#ip-address>, an
opaque host <#opaque-host>, or an empty host <#empty-host>. Typically a
host <#concept-host> serves as a network address, but it is sometimes
used as opaque identifier in URLs <#concept-url> where a network address
is not necessary.

<#example-opaque-host-url>A typical URL <#concept-url> whose host
<#concept-url-host> is an opaque host <#opaque-host> is |git://
github.com/whatwg/url.git|.

The RFCs referenced in the paragraphs below are for informative purposes
only. They have no influence on host <#concept-host> writing, parsing,
and serialization. Unless stated otherwise in the sections that follow.

A domain is a non-empty ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#ascii-string> that identifies a realm within a network. [RFC1034]
<#biblio-rfc1034>

The domain labels of a domain <#concept-domain> domain are the result of
strictly splitting <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strictly-split>
domain on U+002E (.).

The |example.com| and |example.com.| domains <#concept-domain> are not
equivalent and typically treated as distinct.

An IP address is an IPv4 address <#concept-ipv4> or an IPv6 address
<#concept-ipv6>.

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit unsigned integer <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#32-bit-unsigned-integer> that identifies a
network address. [RFC791] <#biblio-rfc791>

An IPv6 address is a 128-bit unsigned integer <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#128-bit-unsigned-integer> that identifies a
network address. This integer is composed of a list <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list> of 8 16-bit unsigned integers <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#16-bit-unsigned-integer>, also known as an IPv6
address <#concept-ipv6>’s pieces. [RFC4291] <#biblio-rfc4291>

Support for |<zone_id>| is intentionally omitted <https://www.w3.org/
Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27234#c2>.

An opaque host is a non-empty ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> that can be used for further
processing.

An empty host is the empty string.


      3.2. Host miscellaneous<#host-miscellaneous>

A forbidden host code point is U+0000 NULL, U+0009 TAB, U+000A LF,
U+000D CR, U+0020 SPACE, U+0023 (#), U+002F (/), U+003A (:), U+003C (<),
U+003E (>), U+003F (?), U+0040 (@), U+005B ([), U+005C (\), U+005D (]),
U+005E (^), or U+007C (|).

A forbidden domain code point is a forbidden host code point
<#forbidden-host-code-point>, a C0 control <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#c0-control>, U+0025 (%), or U+007F DELETE.

To obtain the public suffix of a host <#concept-host> host, run these
steps. They return null or a domain <#concept-domain> representing a
portion of host that is included on the Public Suffix List. [PSL]
<#biblio-psl>

 1.

    If host is not a domain <#concept-domain>, then return null.

 2.

    Let trailingDot be "|.|" if host ends with <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-ends-with> "|.|"; otherwise the empty
    string.

 3.

    Let publicSuffix be the public suffix determined by running the
    Public Suffix List algorithm <https://github.com/publicsuffix/list/
    wiki/Format#formal-algorithm> with host as domain. [PSL] <#biblio-psl>

 4.

    Assert: publicSuffix is an ASCII string <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> that does not end with
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-ends-with> "|.|".

 5.

    Return publicSuffix and trailingDot concatenated.

To obtain the registrable domain of a host <#concept-host> host, run
these steps. They return null or a domain <#concept-domain> formed by
host’s public suffix <#host-public-suffix> and the domain label
<#domain-label> preceding it, if any.

 1.

    If host’s public suffix <#host-public-suffix> is null or host’s
    public suffix <#host-public-suffix> equals <#concept-host-equals>
    host, then return null.

 2.

    Let trailingDot be "|.|" if host ends with <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-ends-with> "|.|"; otherwise the empty
    string.

 3.

    Let registrableDomain be the registrable domain determined by
    running the Public Suffix List algorithm <https://github.com/
    publicsuffix/list/wiki/Format#formal-algorithm> with host as domain.
    [PSL] <#biblio-psl>

 4.

    Assert: registrableDomain is an ASCII string <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> that does not end with
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-ends-with> "|.|".

 5.

    Return registrableDomain and trailingDot concatenated.

Specifications should prefer the origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/
multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin> concept for security decisions.
The notion of "public suffix <#host-public-suffix>" and "registrable
domain <#host-registrable-domain>" cannot be relied-upon to provide a
hard security boundary, as the public suffix list will diverge from
client to client. Specifications which ignore this advice are encouraged
to carefully consider whether URLs' schemes ought to be incorporated
into any decisions made, i.e. whether to use the same site <https://
html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#same-site> or schemelessly
same site <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
browsers.html#schemelessly-same-site> concepts.


      3.3. IDNA<#idna>

The domain to ASCII algorithm, given a string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string> domain and a boolean beStrict, runs these
steps:

 1.

    Let result be the result of running Unicode ToASCII <https://
    www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToASCII> with /domain_name/ set to
    domain, /CheckHyphens/ set to beStrict, /CheckBidi/ set to true, /
    CheckJoiners/ set to true, /UseSTD3ASCIIRules/ set to beStrict, /
    Transitional_Processing/ set to false, /VerifyDnsLength/ set to
    beStrict, and /IgnoreInvalidPunycode/ set to false. [UTS46]
    <#biblio-uts46>

    If beStrict is false, domain is an ASCII string <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>, and strictly splitting
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strictly-split> domain on U+002E (.)
    does not produce any item <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-item>
    that starts with <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-starts-with>
    an ASCII case-insensitive <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-
    case-insensitive> match for "|xn--|", this step is equivalent to
    ASCII lowercasing <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-lowercase>
    domain.

 2.

    If result is a failure value, domain-to-ASCII <#validation-error-
    domain-to-ascii> validation error <#validation-error>, return failure.

 3.

    If beStrict is false:

     1.

        If result is the empty string, domain-to-ASCII <#validation-
        error-domain-to-ascii> validation error <#validation-error>,
        return failure.

     2.

        If result contains a forbidden domain code point <#forbidden-
        domain-code-point>, domain-invalid-code-point <#domain-invalid-
        code-point> validation error <#validation-error>, return failure.

        Due to web compatibility and compatibility with non-DNS-based
        systems the forbidden domain code points <#forbidden-domain-
        code-point> are a subset of those disallowed when /
        UseSTD3ASCIIRules/ is true. See also issue #397 <https://
        github.com/whatwg/url/issues/397>.

 4.

    Assert <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#assert>: result is not the
    empty string and does not contain a forbidden domain code point
    <#forbidden-domain-code-point>.

    Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing guarantees this holds when
    beStrict is true. [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>

 5.

    Return result.

This document and the web platform at large use Unicode IDNA
Compatibility Processing and not IDNA2008. For instance, |☕.example|
becomes |xn--53h.example| and not failure. [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>
[RFC5890] <#biblio-rfc5890>

The domain to Unicode algorithm, given a domain <#concept-domain> domain
and a boolean beStrict, runs these steps:

 1.

    Let result be the result of running Unicode ToUnicode <https://
    www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToUnicode> with /domain_name/ set to
    domain, /CheckHyphens/ set to beStrict, /CheckBidi/ set to true, /
    CheckJoiners/ set to true, /UseSTD3ASCIIRules/ set to beStrict, /
    Transitional_Processing/ set to false, and /IgnoreInvalidPunycode/
    set to false. [UTS46] <#biblio-uts46>

 2.

    Signify domain-to-Unicode <#domain-to-unicode> validation errors
    <#validation-error> for any returned errors, and then, return result.


      3.4. Host writing<#host-writing>

A valid host string must be a valid domain string <#valid-domain-
string>, a valid IPv4-address string <#valid-ipv4-address-string>, or:
U+005B ([), followed by a valid IPv6-address string <#valid-ipv6-
address-string>, followed by U+005D (]).

A string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string> input is a valid domain
if these steps return true:

 1.

    Let domain be the result of running domain to ASCII <#concept-
    domain-to-ascii> with input and true.

 2.

    Return false if domain is failure; otherwise true.

Ideally we define this in terms of a sequence of code points that make
up a valid domain <#valid-domain> rather than through a whack-a-mole:
issue 245 <https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/245>.

A valid domain string must be a string that is a valid domain <#valid-
domain>.

A valid IPv4-address string must be four shortest possible strings of
ASCII digits <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-digit>, representing
a decimal number in the range 0 to 255, inclusive, separated from each
other by U+002E (.).

A valid IPv6-address string is defined in the "Text Representation of
Addresses" chapter of IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture <https://
tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.2>. [RFC4291] <#biblio-rfc4291>

A valid opaque-host string must be one of the following:

  *

    one or more URL units <#url-units> excluding forbidden host code
    points <#forbidden-host-code-point>

  *

    U+005B ([), followed by a valid IPv6-address string <#valid-ipv6-
    address-string>, followed by U+005D (]).

This is not part of the definition of valid host string <#valid-host-
string> as it requires context to be distinguished.


      3.5. Host parsing<#host-parsing>

The host parser takes a scalar value string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input with an optional
boolean isOpaque (default false), and then runs these steps. They return
failure or a host <#concept-host>.

 1.

    If input starts with U+005B ([), then:

     1.

        If input does not end with U+005D (]), IPv6-unclosed <#ipv6-
        unclosed> validation error <#validation-error>, return failure.

     2.

        Return the result of IPv6 parsing <#concept-ipv6-parser> input
        with its leading U+005B ([) and trailing U+005D (]) removed.

 2.

    If isOpaque is true, then return the result of opaque-host parsing
    <#concept-opaque-host-parser> input.

 3.

    Assert: input is not the empty string.

 4.

    Let domain be the result of running UTF-8 decode without BOM
    <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-decode-without-bom> on the
    percent-decoding <#string-percent-decode> of input.

    Alternatively UTF-8 decode without BOM or fail <https://
    encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-decode-without-bom-or-fail> can be
    used, coupled with an early return for failure, as domain to ASCII
    <#concept-domain-to-ascii> fails on U+FFFD (�).

 5.

    Let asciiDomain be the result of running domain to ASCII <#concept-
    domain-to-ascii> with domain and false.

 6.

    If asciiDomain is failure, then return failure.

 7.

    If asciiDomain ends in a number <#ends-in-a-number-checker>, then
    return the result of IPv4 parsing <#concept-ipv4-parser> asciiDomain.

 8.

    Return asciiDomain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ends in a number checker takes an ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> input and then runs these steps.
They return a boolean.

 1.

    Let parts be the result of strictly splitting <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#strictly-split> input on U+002E (.).

 2.

    If the last item <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-item> in parts
    is the empty string, then:

      3.7. Host equivalence<#host-equivalence>

To determine whether a host <#concept-host> A equals host <#concept-
host> B, return true if A is B, and false otherwise.

Certificate comparison requires a host equivalence check that ignores
the trailing dot of a domain (if any). However, those hosts have also
various other facets enforced, such as DNS length, that are not enforced
here, as URLs do not enforce them. If anyone has a good suggestion for
how to bring these two closer together, or what a good unified model
would be, please file an issue.


    4. URLs<#urls>

At a high level, a URL <#concept-url>, valid URL string <#valid-url-
string>, URL parser <#concept-url-parser>, and URL serializer <#concept-
url-serializer> relate as follows:

  *

    The URL parser <#concept-url-parser> takes an arbitrary scalar value
    string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> and
    returns either failure or a URL <#concept-url>. It might also record
    zero or more validation errors <#validation-error>.

  *

    A URL <#concept-url> can be seen as the in-memory representation.

  *

    A valid URL string <#valid-url-string> defines what input would not
    trigger a validation error <#validation-error> or failure when given
    to the URL parser <#concept-url-parser>. I.e., input that would be
    considered conforming or valid.

  *

    The URL serializer <#concept-url-serializer> takes a URL <#concept-
    url> and returns an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
    #ascii-string>. (If that string is then parsed <#concept-url-
    parser>, the result will equal <#concept-url-equals> the URL
    <#concept-url> that was serialized <#concept-url-serializer>.) The

The base and output URL <#concept-url> are represented in serialized
<#concept-url-serializer> form for brevity.


      4.1. URL representation<#url-representation>

A URL is a struct <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#struct> that
represents a universal identifier. To disambiguate from a valid URL
string <#valid-url-string> it can also be referred to as a URL record
<#concept-url>.

A URL <#concept-url>’s scheme is an ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> that identifies the type of URL
<#concept-url> and can be used to dispatch a URL <#concept-url> for
further processing after parsing <#concept-url-parser>. It is initially
the empty string.

A URL <#concept-url>’s username is an ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> identifying a username. It is
initially the empty string.

A URL <#concept-url>’s password is an ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> identifying a password. It is
initially the empty string.

A URL <#concept-url>’s host is null or a host <#concept-host>. It is
initially null.

The following table lists allowed URL <#concept-url>’s scheme <#concept-
url-scheme> / host <#concept-url-host> combinations.

scheme <#concept-url-scheme> 	host <#concept-url-host>
domain <#concept-domain> 	IPv4 address <#concept-ipv4> 	IPv6 address
<#concept-ipv6> 	opaque host <#opaque-host> 	empty host <#empty-host> 	null
Special schemes <#special-scheme> excluding "|file|" 	✅ 	✅ 	✅ 	❌ 	❌
	❌
"|file|" 	✅ 	✅ 	✅ 	❌ 	✅ 	❌
Others 	❌ 	❌ 	✅ 	✅ 	✅ 	✅

A URL <#concept-url>’s port is either null or a 16-bit unsigned integer
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#16-bit-unsigned-integer> that identifies
a networking port. It is initially null.

A URL <#concept-url>’s path is a URL path <#url-path>, usually
identifying a location. It is initially « ».

A special <#is-special> URL <#concept-url>’s path <#concept-url-path> is
always a list <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list>, i.e., it is never
opaque <#url-opaque-path>.

A URL <#concept-url>’s query is either null or an ASCII string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>. It is initially null.

A URL <#concept-url>’s fragment is either null or an ASCII string
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string> that can be used for
further processing on the resource the URL <#concept-url>’s other
components identify. It is initially null.

A URL <#concept-url> also has an associated blob URL entry that is
either null or a blob URL entry <https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#blob-
url-entry>. It is initially null.

This is used to support caching the object a "|blob|" URL refers to as
well as its origin. It is important that these are cached as the URL
<#concept-url> might be removed from the blob URL store <https://
w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#BlobURLStore> between parsing and fetching, while
fetching will still need to succeed.

<#example-url-components>

The following table lists how valid URL strings <#valid-url-string>,
when parsed <#concept-url-parser>, map to a URL <#concept-url>’s
components. Username <#concept-url-username>, password <#concept-url-
password>, and blob URL entry <#concept-url-blob-entry> are omitted; in
the examples below they are the empty string, the empty string, and
null, respectively.

Input 	Scheme <#concept-url-scheme> 	Host <#concept-url-host> 	Port

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A URL path is either a URL path segment <#url-path-segment> or a list
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list> of zero or more URL path segments
<#url-path-segment>.

A URL path segment is an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#ascii-string>. It commonly refers to a directory or a file, but has no
predefined meaning.

A single-dot URL path segment is a URL path segment <#url-path-segment>
that is "|.|" or an ASCII case-insensitive <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive> match for "|%2e|".

A double-dot URL path segment is a URL path segment <#url-path-segment>
that is "|..|" or an ASCII case-insensitive <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-case-insensitive> match for "|.%2e|", "|
%2e.|", or "|%2e%2e|".


      4.2. URL miscellaneous<#url-miscellaneous>

A special scheme is an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#ascii-string> that is listed in the first column of the following
table. The default port for a special scheme <#special-scheme> is listed
in the second column on the same row. The default port <#default-port>
for any other ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>
is null.

Special scheme <#special-scheme> 	Default port <#default-port>
"|ftp|" 	21
"|file|" 	null
"|http|" 	80
"|https|" 	443
"|ws|" 	80
"|wss|" 	443

A URL <#concept-url> is special if its scheme <#concept-url-scheme> is a
special scheme <#special-scheme>. A URL <#concept-url> is not special if
its scheme <#concept-url-scheme> is not a special scheme <#special-scheme>.

A URL <#concept-url> includes credentials if its username <#concept-url-
username> or password <#concept-url-password> is not the empty string.

A URL <#concept-url> has an opaque path if its path <#concept-url-path>
is a URL path segment <#url-path-segment>.

A URL <#concept-url> cannot have a username/password/port if its host
<#concept-url-host> is null or the empty string, or its scheme
<#concept-url-scheme> is "|file|".

A URL <#concept-url> can be designated as base URL.

A base URL <#concept-base-url> is useful for the URL parser <#concept-
url-parser> when the input might be a relative-URL string <#relative-
url-string>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Windows drive letter is two code points, of which the first is an
ASCII alpha <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alpha> and the second
is either U+003A (:) or U+007C (|).

A normalized Windows drive letter is a Windows drive letter <#windows-
drive-letter> of which the second code point is U+003A (:).

As per the URL writing <#url-writing> section, only a normalized Windows
drive letter <#normalized-windows-drive-letter> is conforming.

A string starts with a Windows drive letter if all of the following are
true:

  * its length <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-length> is greater
    than or equal to 2
  * its first two code points are a Windows drive letter <#windows-
    drive-letter>
  * its length <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string-length> is 2 or
    its third code point is U+002F (/), U+005C (\), U+003F (?), or
    U+0023 (#). 

<#example-start-with-a-widows-drive-letter>
String 	Starts with a Windows drive letter
"|c:|" 	✅
"|c:/|" 	✅
"|c:a|" 	❌

To shorten a url’s path:

 1.

    Assert <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#assert>: url does not have an
    opaque path <#url-opaque-path>.

 2.

    Let path be url’s path <#concept-url-path>.

 3.

    If url’s scheme <#concept-url-scheme> is "|file|", path’s size
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-size> is 1, and path[0] is a
    normalized Windows drive letter <#normalized-windows-drive-letter>,
    then return.

 4.

    Remove <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-remove> path’s last
    item, if any.


      4.3. URL writing<#url-writing>

registered in the IANA URI [sic] Schemes registry. [IANA-URI-SCHEMES]
<#biblio-iana-uri-schemes> [RFC7595] <#biblio-rfc7595>

    url-string>

any optionally followed by U+003F (?) and a URL-query string <#url-
query-string>.

A non-null base URL <#concept-base-url> is necessary when parsing
<#concept-url-parser> a relative-URL string <#relative-url-string>.

A scheme-relative-special-URL string must be "|//|", followed by a valid

    path-absolute-non-Windows-file-URL string <#path-absolute-non-
    windows-file-url-string>

  *

A path-absolute-URL string must be U+002F (/) followed by a path-
relative-URL string <#path-relative-url-string>.

A path-absolute-non-Windows-file-URL string must be a path-absolute-URL
string <#path-absolute-url-string> that does not start with: U+002F (/),
followed by a Windows drive letter <#windows-drive-letter>, followed by
U+002F (/).

A path-relative-URL string must be zero or more URL-path-segment strings
<#url-path-segment-string>, separated from each other by U+002F (/), and
not start with U+002F (/).

A path-relative-scheme-less-URL string must be a path-relative-URL
string <#path-relative-url-string> that does not start with: a URL-
scheme string <#url-scheme-string>, followed by U+003A (:).

A URL-path-segment string must be one of the following:

  *

    zero or more URL units <#url-units> excluding U+002F (/) and U+003F
    (?), that together are not a single-dot URL path segment <#single-
    dot-path-segment> or a double-dot URL path segment <#double-dot-
    path-segment>.

  *

    a single-dot URL path segment <#single-dot-path-segment>

  *

    a double-dot URL path segment <#double-dot-path-segment>.

A URL-query string must be zero or more URL units <#url-units>.

A URL-fragment string must be zero or more URL units <#url-units>.

The URL code points are ASCII alphanumeric <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-alphanumeric>, U+0021 (!), U+0024 ($),
U+0026 (&), U+0027 ('), U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS, U+0029 RIGHT
PARENTHESIS, U+002A (*), U+002B (+), U+002C (,), U+002D (-), U+002E (.),
U+002F (/), U+003A (:), U+003B (;), U+003D (=), U+003F (?), U+0040 (@),
U+005F (_), U+007E (~), and code points <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#code-point> in the range U+00A0 to U+10FFFD, inclusive, excluding
surrogates <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#surrogate> and noncharacters
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#noncharacter>.

Code points greater than U+007F DELETE will be converted to percent-
encoded bytes <#percent-encoded-byte> by the URL parser <#concept-url-
parser>.

In HTML, when the document encoding is a legacy encoding, code points in
the URL-query string <#url-query-string> that are higher than U+007F
DELETE will be converted to percent-encoded bytes <#percent-encoded-
byte> /using the document’s encoding/. This can cause problems if a URL
that works in one document is copied to another document that uses a
different document encoding. Using the UTF-8 <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8> encoding everywhere solves this problem.

<#query-encoding-example>

For example, consider this HTML document:

|<!doctype html>
<meta charset="windows-1252">
<a href="?sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord">Test</a>

|

Since the document encoding is windows-1252, the link’s URL <#concept-
url>’s query <#concept-url-query> will be "|sm%F6rg%E5sbord|". If the
document encoding had been UTF-8, it would instead be "|
sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord|".

The URL units are URL code points <#url-code-points> and percent-encoded
bytes <#percent-encoded-byte>.

Percent-encoded bytes <#percent-encoded-byte> can be used to encode code
points that are not URL code points <#url-code-points> or are excluded
from being written.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no way to express a username <#concept-url-username> or
password <#concept-url-password> of a URL record <#concept-url> within a
valid URL string <#valid-url-string>.


      4.4. URL parsing<#url-parsing>

The URL parser takes a scalar value string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input, with an optional null
or base URL <#concept-base-url> base (default null) and an optional
encoding <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding> encoding (default
UTF-8 <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>), and then runs these
steps:

Non-web-browser implementations only need to implement the basic URL
parser <#concept-basic-url-parser>.

How user input in the web browser’s address bar is converted to a URL
record <#concept-url> is out-of-scope of this standard. This standard
does include URL rendering requirements <#url-rendering> as they pertain
trust decisions.

 1.

    Let url be the result of running the basic URL parser <#concept-
    basic-url-parser> on input with base and encoding.

 2.

    If url is failure, return failure.

 3.

    If url’s scheme <#concept-url-scheme> is not "|blob|", return url.

 4.

    Set url’s blob URL entry <#concept-url-blob-entry> to the result of
    resolving the blob URL <https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#blob-url-
    resolve> url, if that did not return failure, and null otherwise.

 5.

    Return url.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The basic URL parser takes a scalar value string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input, with an optional null
or base URL <#concept-base-url> base (default null), an optional
encoding <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding> encoding (default
UTF-8 <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>), an optional URL
<#concept-url> url, and an optional state override state override, and
then runs these steps:

The encoding argument is a legacy concept only relevant for HTML. The
url and state override arguments are only for use by various APIs.
[HTML] <#biblio-html>

When the url and state override arguments are not passed, the basic URL
parser <#concept-basic-url-parser> returns either a new URL <#concept-
url> or failure. If they are passed, the algorithm modifies the passed
url and can terminate without returning anything.

 1.

    If url is not given:

     1.

        Set url to a new URL <#concept-url>.

     2.

        If input contains any leading or trailing C0 control or space
        <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#c0-control-or-space>, invalid-
        URL-unit <#invalid-url-unit> validation error <#validation-error>.

     3.

        Remove any leading and trailing C0 control or space <https://
        infra.spec.whatwg.org/#c0-control-or-space> from input.

 2.

    If input contains any ASCII tab or newline <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-tab-or-newline>, invalid-URL-unit
    <#invalid-url-unit> validation error <#validation-error>.

 3.

    Remove all ASCII tab or newline <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
    #ascii-tab-or-newline> from input.

 4.

    Let state be state override if given, or scheme start state
    <#scheme-start-state> otherwise.

 5.

    Set encoding to the result of getting an output encoding <https://
    encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#get-an-output-encoding> from encoding.

 6.

    Let buffer be the empty string.

 7.

    Let atSignSeen, insideBrackets, and passwordTokenSeen be false.

 8.

    Let pointer be a pointer <#pointer> for input.

 9.

    Keep running the following state machine by switching on state. If
    after a run pointer points to the EOF code point <#eof-code-point>,
    go to the next step. Otherwise, increase pointer by 1 and continue
    with the state machine.

    scheme start state
         1.

            If c <#c> is an ASCII alpha <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
            #ascii-alpha>, append c <#c>, lowercased <https://
            infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-lowercase>, to buffer, and set
            state to scheme state <#scheme-state>.

         2.

            Otherwise, if state override is not given, set state to no
            scheme state <#no-scheme-state> and decrease pointer by 1.

         3.

            Otherwise, return failure.

            This indication of failure is used exclusively by the |
            Location <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-

      4.5. URL serializing<#url-serializing>

The URL serializer takes a URL <#concept-url> url, with an optional
boolean exclude fragment (default false), and then runs these steps.
They return an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>.

 1.

    Let output be url’s scheme <#concept-url-scheme> and U+003A (:)
    concatenated.

 2.

    If url’s host <#concept-url-host> is non-null:

     1.

        Append "|//|" to output.

     2.

        If url includes credentials <#include-credentials>, then:

         1.

            Append url’s username <#concept-url-username> to output.

         2.

            If url’s password <#concept-url-password> is not the empty
            string, then append U+003A (:), followed by url’s password
            <#concept-url-password>, to output.

         3.

            Append U+0040 (@) to output.

     3.

        Append url’s host <#concept-url-host>, serialized <#concept-
        host-serializer>, to output.

     4.

        If url’s port <#concept-url-port> is non-null, append U+003A (:)
        followed by url’s port <#concept-url-port>, serialized
        <#serialize-an-integer>, to output.

 3.

    If url’s host <#concept-url-host> is null, url does not have an
    opaque path <#url-opaque-path>, url’s path <#concept-url-path>’s
    size <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-size> is greater than 1,
    and url’s path <#concept-url-path>[0] is the empty string, then
    append U+002F (/) followed by U+002E (.) to output.

    This prevents |web+demo:/.//not-a-host/| or |web+demo:/path/..//not-
    a-host/|, when parsed <#concept-url-parser> and then serialized
    <#concept-url-serializer>, from ending up as |web+demo://not-a-
    host/| (they end up as |web+demo:/.//not-a-host/|).

 4.

    Append the result of URL path serializing <#url-path-serializer> url
    to output.

 5.

    If url’s query <#concept-url-query> is non-null, append U+003F (?),
    followed by url’s query <#concept-url-query>, to output.

 6.

    If exclude fragment is false and url’s fragment <#concept-url-
    fragment> is non-null, then append U+0023 (#), followed by url’s
    fragment <#concept-url-fragment>, to output.

 7.

    Return output.

The URL path serializer takes a URL <#concept-url> url and then runs
these steps. They return an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/
#ascii-string>.

 1.

    If url has an opaque path <#url-opaque-path>, then return url’s path
    <#concept-url-path>.

 2.

    Let output be the empty string.

 3.

    For each <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-iterate> segment of
    url’s path <#concept-url-path>: append U+002F (/) followed by
    segment to output.

 4.

    Return output.


      4.6. URL equivalence<#url-equivalence>

To determine whether a URL <#concept-url> A equals URL <#concept-url> B,
with an optional boolean exclude fragments (default false), run these
steps:

 1.

    Let serializedA be the result of serializing <#concept-url-
    serializer> A, with /exclude fragment/ <#url-serializer-exclude-
    fragment> set to exclude fragments.

 2.

    Let serializedB be the result of serializing <#concept-url-
    serializer> B, with /exclude fragment/ <#url-serializer-exclude-
    fragment> set to exclude fragments.

 3.

    Return true if serializedA is serializedB; otherwise false.


      4.7. Origin<#origin>

See origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
browsers.html#concept-origin>’s definition in HTML for the necessary
background information. [HTML] <#biblio-html>

The origin of a URL <#concept-url> url is the origin <https://
html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin> returned by
running these steps, switching on url’s scheme <#concept-url-scheme>:

"|blob|"

     1.

        If url’s blob URL entry <#concept-url-blob-entry> is non-null,
        then return url’s blob URL entry <#concept-url-blob-entry>’s
        environment <https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#blob-url-entry-
        environment>’s origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
        webappapis.html#concept-settings-object-origin>.

     2.

        Let pathURL be the result of parsing <#concept-basic-url-parser>
        the result of URL path serializing <#url-path-serializer> url.

     3.

        If pathURL is failure, then return a new opaque origin <https://
        html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-
        opaque>.

     4.

        If pathURL’s scheme <#concept-url-scheme> is "|http|", "|
        https|", or "|file|", then return pathURL’s origin <#concept-
        url-origin>.

     5.

        Return a new opaque origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/
        multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque>.

    <#example-43b5cea5>The origin <#concept-url-origin> of |
    blob:https://whatwg.org/d0360e2f-caee-469f-9a2f-87d5b0456f6f| is the
    tuple origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
    browsers.html#concept-origin-tuple> ("|https|", "|whatwg.org|",
    null, null).

"|ftp|"
"|http|"
"|https|"
"|ws|"
"|wss|"

    Return the tuple origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
    browsers.html#concept-origin-tuple> (url’s scheme <#concept-url-
    scheme>, url’s host <#concept-url-host>, url’s port <#concept-url-
    port>, null).

"|file|"

    Unfortunate as it is, this is left as an exercise to the reader.
    When in doubt, return a new opaque origin <https://
    html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque>.

Otherwise

    Return a new opaque origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
    browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque>.

    This does indeed mean that these URLs <#concept-url> cannot be same
    origin <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#same-
    origin> with themselves.


      4.8. URL rendering<#url-rendering>

A URL <#concept-url> should be rendered in its serialized <#concept-url-
serializer> form, with modifications described below, when the primary
purpose of displaying a URL is to have the user make a security or trust
decision. For example, users are expected to make trust decisions based
on a URL rendered in the browser address bar.


        4.8.1. Simplify non-human-readable or irrelevant
        components<#url-rendering-simplification>

Remove components that can provide opportunities for spoofing or
distract from security-relevant information:

  *

    Browsers may render only a URL’s host <#concept-url-host> in places
    where it is important for end users to distinguish between the host
    and other parts of the URL such as the path <#concept-url-path>.
    Browsers may consider simplifying the host further to draw attention
    to its registrable domain <#host-registrable-domain>. For example,
    browsers may omit a leading |www| or |m| domain label <#domain-
    label> to simplify the host, or display its registrable domain only
    to remove spoofing opportunities posted by subdomains (e.g., |
    https://examplecorp.attacker.com/|).

  *

    Browsers should not render a URL <#concept-url>’s username
    <#concept-url-username> and password <#concept-url-password>, as
    they can be mistaken for a URL <#concept-url>’s host <#concept-url-
    host> (e.g., |https://examplecorp.com@attacker.example/|).

  *

    Browsers may render a URL without its scheme <#concept-url-scheme>
    if the display surface only ever permits a single scheme (such as a
    browser feature that omits |https://| because it is only enabled for
    secure origins). Otherwise, the scheme may be replaced or
    supplemented with a human-readable string (e.g., "Not secure"), a
    security indicator icon, or both.


        4.8.2. Elision<#url-rendering-elision>

In a space-constrained display, URLs should be elided carefully to avoid
misleading the user when making a security decision:

  *

    Browsers should ensure that at least the registrable domain <#host-
    registrable-domain> can be shown when the URL is rendered (to avoid
    showing, e.g., |...examplecorp.com| when loading |https://not-
    really-examplecorp.com/|).

  *

    When the full host <#concept-url-host> cannot be rendered, browsers
    should elide domain labels <#domain-label> starting from the lowest-
    level domain label. For example, |examplecorp.com.evil.com| should
    be elided as |...com.evil.com|, not |examplecorp.com...|. (Note that
    bidirectional text means that the lowest-level domain label may not
    appear on the left.)


        4.8.3. Internationalization and special characters<#url-
        rendering-i18n>

Internationalized domain names (IDNs), special characters, and
bidirectional text should be handled with care to prevent spoofing:

  *

    Browsers should render a URL <#concept-url>’s host <#concept-url-
    host> by running domain to Unicode <#concept-domain-to-unicode> with
    the URL <#concept-url>’s host <#concept-url-host> and false.

    Various characters can be used in homograph spoofing attacks.
    Consider detecting confusable characters and warning when they are
    in use. [IDNFAQ] <#biblio-idnfaq> [UTS39] <#biblio-uts39>

  *

    URLs are particularly prone to confusion between host and path when
    they contain bidirectional text, so in this case it is particularly
    advisable to only render a URL’s host <#concept-url-host>. For
    readability, other parts of the URL <#concept-url>, if rendered,
    should have their sequences of percent-encoded bytes <#percent-
    encoded-byte> replaced with code points resulting from running UTF-8
    decode without BOM <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-decode-
    without-bom> on the percent-decoding <#string-percent-decode> of
    those sequences, unless that renders those sequences invisible.
    Browsers may choose to not decode certain sequences that present
    spoofing risks (e.g., U+1F512 (🔒)).

  *

    Browsers should render bidirectional text as if it were in a left-
    to-right embedding. [BIDI] <#biblio-bidi>

    Unfortunately, as rendered URLs <#concept-url> are strings and can
    appear anywhere, a specific bidirectional algorithm for rendered
    URLs <#concept-url> would not see wide adoption. Bidirectional text
    interacts with the parts of a URL <#concept-url> in ways that can
    cause the rendering to be different from the model. Users of
    bidirectional languages can come to expect this, particularly in
    plain text environments.


    5. |application/x-www-form-urlencoded|<#application/x-www-form-
    urlencoded>

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| format provides a way to encode
a list <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list> of tuples <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple>, each consisting of a name and a value.

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| format is in many ways an
aberrant monstrosity, the result of many years of implementation
accidents and compromises leading to a set of requirements necessary for
interoperability, but in no way representing good design practices. In
particular, readers are cautioned to pay close attention to the twisted
details involving repeated (and in some cases nested) conversions
between character encodings and byte sequences. Unfortunately the format
is in widespread use due to the prevalence of HTML forms. [HTML]
<#biblio-html>


      5.1. |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| parsing<#urlencoded-parsing>

A legacy server-oriented implementation might have to support encodings
<https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding> other than UTF-8 <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8> as well as have special logic for
tuples of which the name is `|_charset|`. Such logic is not described
here as only UTF-8 <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8> is conforming.

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| parser takes a byte sequence
input, and then runs these steps:

 1.

    Let sequences be the result of splitting input on 0x26 (&).

 2.

    Let output be an initially empty list <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list> of name-value tuples where both name
    and value hold a string.

 3.

    For each <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-iterate> byte sequence
    bytes in sequences:

     1.

        If bytes is the empty byte sequence, then continue <https://
        infra.spec.whatwg.org/#iteration-continue>.

     2.

        If bytes contains a 0x3D (=), then let name be the bytes from
        the start of bytes up to but excluding its first 0x3D (=), and
        let value be the bytes, if any, after the first 0x3D (=) up to
        the end of bytes. If 0x3D (=) is the first byte, then name will
        be the empty byte sequence. If it is the last, then value will
        be the empty byte sequence.

     3.

        Otherwise, let name have the value of bytes and let value be the
        empty byte sequence.

     4.

        Replace any 0x2B (+) in name and value with 0x20 (SP).

    Return output.


      5.2. |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| serializing<#urlencoded-
      serializing>

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| serializer takes a list of name-
value tuples tuples, with an optional encoding <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#encoding> encoding (default UTF-8 <https://
encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8>), and then runs these steps. They
return an ASCII string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#ascii-string>.

 1.

    Set encoding to the result of getting an output encoding <https://
    encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#get-an-output-encoding> from encoding.

 2.

    Let output be the empty string.

 3.

    For each <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-iterate> tuple of tuples:

     1.

        Assert <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#assert>: tuple’s name and
        tuple’s value are scalar value strings <https://
        infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string>.

     2.

        Let name be the result of running percent-encode after encoding
        <#string-percent-encode-after-encoding> with encoding, tuple’s
        name, the |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode set
        <#application-x-www-form-urlencoded-percent-encode-set>, and true.

     3.

        Let value be the result of running percent-encode after encoding
        <#string-percent-encode-after-encoding> with encoding, tuple’s
        value, the |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode
        set <#application-x-www-form-urlencoded-percent-encode-set>, and
        true.

     4.

        If output is not the empty string, then append U+0026 (&) to
        output.

     5. Append name, followed by U+003D (=), followed by value, to output. 
 4. Return output. 


      5.3. Hooks<#urlencoded-hooks>

The |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| string parser takes a scalar
value string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> input,
UTF-8 encodes <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#utf-8-encode> it, and
then returns the result of |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| parsing
<#concept-urlencoded-parser> it.

A |URL <#url>| object has an associated:

  * URL: a URL <#concept-url>.
  * query object: a |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object. 

The API URL parser takes a scalar value string <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string> url and an optional null-or-
scalar value string <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#scalar-value-string>
base (default null), and then runs these steps:

 1.

    Let parsedBase be null.

 2.

    If base is non-null:

     1.

        Set parsedBase to the result of running the basic URL parser
        <#concept-basic-url-parser> on base.

     2.

        If parsedBase is failure, then return failure.

 3.

    Return the result of running the basic URL parser <#concept-basic-
    url-parser> on url with parsedBase.

To initialize a |URL <#url>| object url with a URL <#concept-url>
urlRecord:

 1.

    Let query be urlRecord’s query <#concept-url-query>, if that is non-
    null; otherwise the empty string.

 2.

    Set url’s URL <#concept-url-url> to urlRecord.

 3.

    Set url’s query object <#concept-url-query-object> to a new |
    URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object.

 4.

    Initialize <#urlsearchparams-initialize> url’s query object
    <#concept-url-query-object> with query.

 5.

    Set url’s query object <#concept-url-query-object>’s URL object
    <#concept-urlsearchparams-url-object> to url.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The |new URL(url, base)| constructor steps are:

 1.

    Let parsedURL be the result of running the API URL parser <#api-url-
    parser> on url with base, if given.

 2.

    If parsedURL is failure, then throw <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
    #dfn-throw> a |TypeError <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
    #exceptiondef-typeerror>|.

 3.

    Initialize <#url-initialize> this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
    #this> with parsedURL.

<#example-5434421b>

To parse <#concept-basic-url-parser> a string into a URL <#concept-url>
without using a base URL <#concept-base-url>, invoke the |URL <#url>|
constructor with a single argument:

|var input = "https://example.org/💩",
    url = new URL(input)
url.pathname // "/%F0%9F%92%A9"

|

This throws an exception if the input is a relative-URL string
<#relative-url-string>:

|try {
  var url = new URL("/🍣🍺")
} catch(e) {
  // that happened
}

|

For those cases a base URL <#concept-base-url> is necessary:

|var input = "/🍣🍺",
    url = new URL(input, document.baseURI)
url.href // "https://url.spec.whatwg.org/%F0%9F%8D%A3%F0%9F%8D%BA"

|

A |URL <#url>| object can be used as a base URL <#concept-base-url> (as
the IDL requires a string as argument, a |URL <#url>| object stringifies
to its |href <#dom-url-href>| getter return value):

|var url = new URL("🏳️‍🌈", new URL("https://pride.example/hello-world"))
url.pathname // "/%F0%9F%8F%B3%EF%B8%8F%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8C%88"

|

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.

    If parsedURL is failure, then return null.

 3.

    Let url be a new |URL <#url>| object.

 4.

    Initialize <#url-initialize> url with parsedURL.

 5.

    Return url.

 3.

    Set this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-
    url> to parsedURL.

 4.

    Empty this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s query object
    <#concept-url-query-object>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.

 5.

    Let query be this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL
    <#concept-url-url>’s query <#concept-url-query>.

start-state> as /state override/ <#basic-url-parser-state-override>.

The |username| getter steps are to return this <https://
webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-url>’s username

 2.

    Set the username <#set-the-username> given this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-url> and the given
    value.

 2.

    Set the password <#set-the-password> given this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-url> and the given
    value.

The |host| getter steps are:

 1.

    Let url be this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL
    <#concept-url-url>.

 2.

    If url’s host <#concept-url-host> is null, then return the empty
    string.

 3.

    If url’s port <#concept-url-port> is null, return url’s host
    <#concept-url-host>, serialized <#concept-host-serializer>.

 4.

    Return url’s host <#concept-url-host>, serialized <#concept-host-
    serializer>, followed by U+003A (:) and url’s port <#concept-url-
    port>, serialized <#serialize-an-integer>.

The |host <#dom-url-host>| setter steps are:

 1.

    If this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-
    url> has an opaque path <#url-opaque-path>, then return.

 2.

    Basic URL parse <#concept-basic-url-parser> the given value with

    state override/ <#basic-url-parser-state-override>.

If the given value for the |host <#dom-url-host>| setter lacks a port
<#url-port-string>, this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL
<#concept-url-url>’s port <#concept-url-port> will not change. This can
be unexpected as |host| getter does return a URL-port string <#url-port-

The |port| getter steps are:

 1.

    If this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-

    <#concept-url-port> to null.

 3.

    Otherwise, basic URL parse <#concept-basic-url-parser> the given

serializing <#url-path-serializer> this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
#this>’s URL <#concept-url-url>.

The |pathname <#dom-url-pathname>| setter steps are:

 1.

    If this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL <#concept-url-

    Let url be this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s URL
    <#concept-url-url>.

    Let input be the given value with a single leading U+003F (?)
    removed, if any.

 4.

    Set url’s query <#concept-url-query> to the empty string.

 5.

    Basic URL parse <#concept-basic-url-parser> input with url as /url/

<#example-constructing-urlsearchparams>

Constructing and stringifying a |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>|
object is fairly straightforward:

|let params = new URLSearchParams({key: "730d67"})
params.toString() // "key=730d67"

|

As a |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object uses the |application/
x-www-form-urlencoded| <#concept-urlencoded> format underneath there are
some difference with how it encodes certain code points compared to a |
URL <#url>| object (including |href <#dom-url-href>| and |search <#dom-
url-search>|). This can be especially surprising when using |
searchParams <#dom-url-searchparams>| to operate on a URL <#concept-
url>’s query <#concept-url-query>.

|const url = new URL('https://example.com/?a=b ~');
console.log(url.href);   // "https://example.com/?a=b%20~"
url.searchParams.sort();
console.log(url.href);   // "https://example.com/?a=b+%7E"

|

|const url = new URL('https://example.com/?a=~&b=%7E');
console.log(url.search);                // "?a=~&b=%7E"
console.log(url.searchParams.get('a')); // "~"
console.log(url.searchParams.get('b')); // "~"

|

|URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| objects will percent-encode
anything in the |application/x-www-form-urlencoded| percent-encode set
<#application-x-www-form-urlencoded-percent-encode-set>, and will encode
U+0020 SPACE as U+002B (+).

Ignoring encodings (use UTF-8 <https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/
#utf-8>), |search <#dom-url-search>| will percent-encode anything in the
query percent-encode set <#query-percent-encode-set> or the special-
query percent-encode set <#special-query-percent-encode-set> (depending
on whether or not the URL <#concept-url> is special <#is-special>).

A |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object has an associated:

  * list: a list <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list> of tuples
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> each consisting of a name and
    a value, initially empty.
  * URL object: null or a |URL <#url>| object, initially null. 

To initialize a |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object query with
init:

 1.

    If init is a sequence <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-
    sequence>, then for each <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-
    iterate> innerSequence of init:

     1.

        If innerSequence’s size <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-
        size> is not 2, then throw <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-
        throw> a |TypeError <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
        #exceptiondef-typeerror>|.

     2.

        Append <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-append>
        (innerSequence[0], innerSequence[1]) to query’s list <#concept-
        urlsearchparams-list>.

 2.

    Otherwise, if init is a record <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-
    record>, then for each <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#map-iterate>
    name → value of init, append <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-
    append> (name, value) to query’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.

 3.

    Otherwise:

     1.

        Assert: init is a string.

     2.

        Set query’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list> to the result
        of parsing <#concept-urlencoded-string-parser> init.

To update a |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object query:

 1.

    If query’s URL object <#concept-urlsearchparams-url-object> is null,
    then return.

 2.

    Let serializedQuery be the serialization <#concept-urlencoded-
    serializer> of query’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.

 3.

    If serializedQuery is the empty string, then set serializedQuery to
    null.

 4.

    Set query’s URL object <#concept-urlsearchparams-url-object>’s URL
    <#concept-url-url>’s query <#concept-url-query> to serializedQuery.

The |new URLSearchParams(init)| constructor steps are:

 1.

    If init is a string and starts with U+003F (?), then remove the
    first code point from init.

 2.

    Initialize <#urlsearchparams-initialize> this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this> with init.

The |size| getter steps are to return this <https://
webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>’s
size <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-size>.

The |append(name, value)| method steps are:

 1.

    Append <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-append> (name, value) to
    this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list>.

 2.

    Update <#concept-urlsearchparams-update> this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>.

The |delete(name, value)| method steps are:

 1.

    If value is given, then remove <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-
    remove> all tuples <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name
    is name and value is value from this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.

 2.

    Otherwise, remove <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-remove> all
    tuples <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name is name
    from this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list>.

 3.

    Update <#concept-urlsearchparams-update> this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>.

The |get(name)| method steps are to return the value of the first tuple
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name is name in this
<https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-
list>, if there is such a tuple <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple>;
otherwise null.

The |getAll(name)| method steps are to return the values of all tuples
<https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name is name in this
<https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-
list>, in list order; otherwise the empty sequence.

The |has(name, value)| method steps are:

 1.

    If value is given and there is a tuple <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name is name and value is value
    in this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list>, then return true.

 2.

    If value is not given and there is a tuple <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose name is name in this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-
    list>, then return true.

 3.

    Return false.

The |set(name, value)| method steps are:

 1.

    If this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list> contains <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-
    contain> any tuples <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> whose
    name is name, then set the value of the first such tuple <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> to value and remove <https://
    infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-remove> the others.

 2.

    Otherwise, append <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-append>
    (name, value) to this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list
    <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.

 3.

    Update <#concept-urlsearchparams-update> this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<#example-searchparams-sort>

It can be useful to sort the name-value tuples in a |URLSearchParams
<#urlsearchparams>| object, in particular to increase cache hits. This
can be accomplished through invoking the |sort() <#dom-urlsearchparams-
sort>| method:

|const url = new URL("https://example.org/?q=🏳️‍🌈&key=e1f7bc78");
url.searchParams.sort();
url.search; // "?key=e1f7bc78&q=%F0%9F%8F%B3%EF%B8%8F%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8C%88"

|

To avoid altering the original input, e.g., for comparison purposes,
construct a new |URLSearchParams <#urlsearchparams>| object:

|const sorted = new URLSearchParams(url.search)
sorted.sort()

|

The |sort()| method steps are:

 1.

    Set this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list> to the result of sorting in ascending order
    <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#list-sort-in-ascending-order> this
    <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-
    urlsearchparams-list>, with a being less than b if a’s name is code
    unit less than <https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#code-unit-less-than>
    b’s name.

 2.

    Update <#concept-urlsearchparams-update> this <https://
    webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The value pairs to iterate over <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-
value-pairs-to-iterate-over> are this <https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/
#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>’s tuples <https://
infra.spec.whatwg.org/#tuple> with the key being the name and the value
being the value.

The stringification behavior steps are to return the serialization
<#concept-urlencoded-serializer> of this <https://
webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this>’s list <#concept-urlsearchparams-list>.


      6.3. URL APIs elsewhere<#url-apis-elsewhere>

A standard that exposes URLs <#concept-url>, should expose the URL
<#concept-url> as a string (by serializing <#concept-url-serializer> an
internal URL <#concept-url>). A standard should not expose a URL
<#concept-url> using a |URL <#url>| object. |URL <#url>| objects are
meant for URL <#concept-url> manipulation. In IDL the USVString type
should be used.

The higher-level notion here is that values are to be exposed as
immutable data structures.

If a standard decides to use a variant of the name "URL" for a feature
it defines, it should name such a feature "url" (i.e., lowercase and
with an "l" at the end). Names such as "URL", "URI", and "IRI" should
not be used. However, if the name is a compound, "URL" (i.e., uppercase)
is preferred, e.g., "newURL" and "oldURL".

The |EventSource <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-
events.html#eventsource>| and |HashChangeEvent <https://
html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/nav-history-apis.html#hashchangeevent>|
interfaces in HTML are examples of proper naming. [HTML] <#biblio-html>


    Acknowledgments<#acknowledgments>

There have been a lot of people that have helped make URLs <#concept-
url> more interoperable over the years and thereby furthered the goals
of this standard. Likewise many people have helped making this standard
what it is today.
