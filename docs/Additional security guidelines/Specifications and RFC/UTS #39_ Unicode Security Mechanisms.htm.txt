    3 Identifier Characters <#Identifier_Characters>

Identifiers ("IDs") are strings used in application contexts to refer to
specific entities of certain significance in the given application. In a
given application, an identifier will map to at most one specific
entity. Many applications have security requirements related to
identifiers. A common example is URLs referring to pages or other
resources on the Internet: when a user wishes to access a resource, it
is important that the user can be certain what resource they are
interacting with. For example, they need to know that they are
interacting with a particular financial service and not some other
entity that is spoofing the intended service for malicious purposes.
This illustrates a general security concern for identifiers: potential
ambiguity of strings. While a machine has no difficulty distinguishing
between any two different character sequences, it could be very
difficult for humans to recognize and distinguish identifiers if an
application did not limit which Unicode characters could be in
identifiers. The focus of this specification is mitigation of such
issues related to the security of identifiers.

Deliberately restricting the characters that can be used in identifiers
is an important security technique. The exclusion of characters from
identifiers does not affect the general use of those characters for
other purposes, such as for general text in documents. Unicode Standard
Annex #31, "Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax" [UAX31 <#UAX31>]
provides a recommended method of determining which strings should
qualify as identifiers. The UAX #31 specification extends the common
practice of defining identifiers in terms of letters and numbers to the
Unicode repertoire.

That specification also permits other protocols to use that method as a
base, and to define a /profile/ that adds or removes characters. For
example, identifiers for specific programming languages typically add
some characters like "$", and remove others like "-" (because of the use
as /minus/), while IDNA removes "_" (among others)—see Unicode Technical
Standard #46, "Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing" [UTS46 <#UTS46>],
as well as [IDNA2003 <#IDNA2003>], and [IDNA2008 <#IDNA2008>].

This document provides for additional identifier profiles for
environments where security is an issue. These are profiles of the
extended identifiers based on properties and specifications of the
Unicode Standard [Unicode <#Unicode>], including:

  * The XID_Start and XID_Continue properties defined in the Unicode
    Character Database (see [DCore <#DCore>])
  * The toCasefold(X) operation defined in /Chapter 3, Conformance/ of
    [Unicode <#Unicode>]
  * The NFKC and NFKD normalizations defined in /Chapter 3, Conformance/
    of [Unicode <#Unicode>]

The data files used in defining these profiles follow the UCD File
Format, which has a semicolon-delimited list of data fields associated
with given characters, with each field referenced by number. For more
details, see [UCDFormat <#UCDFormat>].


      3.1 General Security Profile for Identifiers
      <#General_Security_Profile>

The files under [idmod <#idmod>] provide data for a profile of
identifiers in environments where security is at issue. The files
contain a set of characters recommended to be restricted from use. They
also contain a small set of characters that are recommended as additions
to the list of characters defined by the XID_Start and XID_Continue
properties, because they may be used in identifiers in a broader context
than programming identifiers.

The Restricted characters are characters not in common use, and they can
be blocked to further reduce the possibilities for visual confusion.
They include the following:

  * characters not in modern use
  * characters only used in specialized fields, such as liturgical
    characters, phonetic letters, and mathematical letter-like symbols
  * characters in limited use by very small communities

The choice of which characters to specify as Restricted starts
conservatively, but allows additions in the future as requirements for
characters are refined. For information on handling modifications over
time, see /2.10.1, Backward Compatibility/ in /Unicode Technical Report
#36, "Unicode Security Considerations"/ [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

An implementation following the General Security Profile does not permit
any characters in \p{Identifier_Status=Restricted}, unless it documents
the additional characters that it does allow. Such documentation can
specify characters via properties, such as
\p{Identifier_Type=Technical}, or by explicit lists, or by combinations
of these. Implementations may also specify that fewer characters are
allowed than implied by \p{Identifier_Status=Allowed}; for example, they
can allow only characters permitted by [IDNA2008 <#IDNA2008>].

Common candidates for such additions include characters for scripts
listed in /Table 7, Limited Use Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/
reports/tr31/#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/ of [UAX31 <#UAX31>]. However,
characters from these scripts have not been a priority for examination
for confusables or to determine specialized, non-modern, or uncommon-use
characters.

Canonical equivalence is applied when testing candidate identifiers for
inclusion of /Allowed/ characters. For example, suppose the candidate
string is the sequence

<u, /combining-diaeresis/>

The target string would be Allowed in /either/ of the following 2
situations:

 1. u is Allowed and ¨ is Allowed, or
 2. ü is Allowed

For details of the format for the [idmod <#idmod>] files, see /Section
7, Data Files <#Data_Files>/.

Table 1. Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type <#Identifier_Status_and_Type>

Identifier_Status 	Identifier_Type 	Description
Restricted <#restricted> 	Not_Character 	Unassigned characters, private
use characters, surrogates, non-whitespace control characters.
Deprecated 	Characters with the Unicode property /Deprecated=Yes/.
Default_Ignorable 	Characters with the Unicode property /
Default_Ignorable_Code_Point=Yes/.
Not_NFKC 	Characters that cannot occur in strings normalized to NFKC.
Not_XID 	Characters that do not qualify as default Unicode identifiers;
that is, they do not have the Unicode property /XID_Continue=True/.
Exclusion 	Characters with Script_Extensions values containing a script
in /Table 4, Excluded Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers> /from [UAX31
<#UAX31>], and no script from /Table 7, Limited Use Scripts <https://
www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/ or /Table 5,
Recommended Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/, other than “Common” or “Inherited”.
Obsolete 	Characters that are no longer in modern use, or that are not
commonly used in modern text.
Technical 	Specialized usage: technical, liturgical, etc.
Uncommon_Use 	

Characters that are uncommon, or are limited in use (even though they
are in scripts that are not "Limited_Use"), or whose usage is uncertain.

May be combined with Exclusion or Limited_Use for characters that are
less common than the main characters of their scripts.

Limited_Use 	Characters from scripts that are in limited use: with
Script_Extensions values containing a script in /Table 7, Limited Use
Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/ in [UAX31 <#UAX31>], and no script from /
Table 5, Recommended Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/, other than “Common” or “Inherited”.
Allowed <#allowed> 	*Inclusion* 	Exceptionally allowed characters,
including /Table 3a, Optional Characters for Medial <https://
www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Optional_Medial>/ and /Table 3b,
Optional Characters for Continue <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Optional_Continue>/ in [UAX31 <#UAX31>], and some characters for
[IDNA2008 <#IDNA2008>], except for certain characters that are
Restricted above.
*Recommended* 	Characters from scripts that are in widespread everyday
common use: with Script_Extensions values containing a script in /Table
5, Recommended Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/ in [UAX31 <#UAX31>], except for those
characters that are Restricted above.

    *Note:* In Unicode 15.0, the Joiner_Control characters (ZWJ/ZWNJ)
    have been removed from Identifier_Type=Inclusion <https://
    util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?
    a=[:Identifier_Type=Inclusion:]>. They thereby have the properties
    Identifier_Type=Default_Ignorable <https://util.unicode.org/
    UnicodeJsps/list-unicodeset.jsp?
    a=[:Identifier_Type=Default_Ignorable:]> and
    Identifier_Status=Restricted <https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/
    list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[:Identifier_Status=Restricted:]>. Their
    inclusion in programming language identifier profiles has usability
    and security implications.

    Implementations of the General Profile for Identifiers that wish to
    retain ZWJ and ZWNJ should declare that they use a modification of
    the profile per /Section 2, Conformance <#Conformance>/, and should
    ensure that they implement the restrictions described in /Section
    3.1.1, Joining Controls <#Joining_Controls>/.

Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type are properties of characters (code
points). See /UTS #18: Unicode Regular Expressions/ [UTS18 <#UTS18>]
and /UTR #23: The Unicode Character Property Model/ [UTR23 <#UTR23>] for
more discussion. For the purpose of regular expressions, the long and
short names of these properties and their values are documented in their
respective data files; see /Section 7, Data Files <#Data_Files>/.

For stability considerations, see Migrating Persistent Data
<#Migrating_Persistent_Data>.

There may be multiple reasons for restricting a character; therefore,
the Identifier_Type property allows multiple values that correspond with
Restricted. For example, some characters have Identifier_Type values of
Limited_Use and Technical. Multiple values are not assigned to
characters with strong restrictions: Not_Character, Deprecated,
Default_Ignorable, Not_NFKC. For example, if a character is Deprecated,
there is little value in also marking it as Uncommon_Use. For the
qualifiers on usage, Obsolete, Uncommon_Use and Technical, the
distinctions among the Identifier_Type values is not strict and only one
might be given. The important characteristic is the Identifier_Status:
whether or not the character is Restricted.

The default Identifier_Type property value should be Uncommon_Use if no
other categories apply.

/As more information is gathered about characters, this data may change
in successive versions./ That can cause either the Identifier_Status or
Identifier_Type to change for a particular character. Thus users of this
data should be prepared for changes in successive versions, such as by
having a grandfathering policy in place for previously supported
characters or registrations. Both Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type
values are to be compared case-insensitively and ignoring hyphens and
underbars.

Restricted characters should be treated with caution when considering
possible use in identifiers, and should be disallowed unless there is
good reason to allow them in the environment in question. However, the
set of Identifier_Status=Allowed characters are not typically used as is
by implementations. Instead, they are applied as filters to the set of
characters C that are supported by the identifier syntax, generating a
new set C′. Typically there are also particular characters or classes of
characters from C that are retained as *Exception* characters.

C′ = (C ∩ {Identifier_Status=Allowed}) ∪ *Exception*

The implementation may simply restrict use of new identifiers to C′, or
may apply some other strategy. For example, there might be an appeal
process for registrations of ids that contain characters outside of C′
(but still inside of C), or in user interfaces for lookup of
identifiers, warnings of some kind may be appropriate. For more
information, see [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

The *Exception* characters would be implementation-specific. For
example, a particular implementation might extend the default Unicode
identifier syntax by adding *Exception* characters with the Unicode
property /XID_Continue=False/, such as “$”, “-”, and “.”. Those
characters are specific to that identifier syntax, and would be retained
even though they are not in the Identifier_Status=Allowed set. Some
implementations may also wish to add some [CLDR <#CLDR>] exemplar
characters for particular supported languages that have unusual characters.

The Identifier_Type=Inclusion characters already contain some characters
that are not letters or numbers, but that are used within words in some
languages. For example, it is recommended that U+00B7 (·) MIDDLE DOT be
allowed in identifiers, because it is required for Catalan.

The implementation may also apply other restrictions discussed in this
document, such as checking for confusable characters or doing mixed-
script detection.


      3.1.1 Joining Controls <#Joining_Controls>

Visible distinctions created by certain characters excluded by the
General Security Profile because their Identifier_Type is
Default_Ignorable (particularly the /Join_Control characters/) are
necessary in certain languages. A blanket exclusion of these characters
makes it impossible to create identifiers with the correct visual
appearance for common words or phrases in those languages.

Identifier systems that attempt to provide more natural representations
of terms in "modern, customary usage" should allow these characters in
input and display, but limit them to contexts in which they are
necessary. The term /modern customary usage/ includes characters that
are in common use in newspapers, journals, lay publications; on street
signs; in commercial signage; and as part of common geographic names and
company names, and so on. It does not include technical or academic
usage such as in mathematical expressions, using archaic scripts or
words, or pedagogical use (such as illustration of half-forms or joining
forms in isolation), or liturgical use.

The goals for such a restriction of format characters to particular
contexts are to:

  * Allow the use of these characters where required in normal text
  * Exclude as many cases as possible where no visible distinction results
  * Be simple enough to be easily implemented with standard mechanisms
    such as regular expressions

An implementation following the General Security Profile that allows the
additional characters ZWJ and ZWNJ shall only permit them where they
satisfy the conditions A1, A2, and B in /Section 3.1.1.1, Limited
Contexts for Joiner Controls <#Limited_Contexts_for_Joining_Controls>/,
unless it documents the additional contexts where it allows them.

More advanced implementations may use script-specific information for
more detailed testing. In particular, they can:

1. /Disallow joining controls/ in sequences that meet the conditions of
A1, A2, and B, where in common fonts the resulting appearance of the
sequence is normally not distinct from appearance in the same sequences
with the joining controls removed.

2. /Allow joining controls/ in sequences that don't meet the conditions
of A1, A2, and B, where in common fonts the resulting appearance of the
sequence is normally distinct from the appearance in the same sequences
with the joining controls removed. The following regular expressions
describe sequences that typically result in distinct rendering. They use
the notation explained below in A1 <#A1>.

    /$L ZWNJ $V $L/

    /$L ZWJ $V $L/


        3.1.1.1 Limited Contexts for Joining Controls
        <#Limited_Contexts_for_Joining_Controls>

An implementation that attempts to provide more natural representations
of terms in "modern, customary usage" should allow the following
Join_Control characters in the limited contexts specified in A1 <#A1>,
A2 <#A2>, and B <#B> below.

    U+200C ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER (ZWNJ)
    U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER (ZWJ) 

There are also two global conditions incorporated in each of A1 <#A1>,
A2 <#A2>, and B <#B>:

  * *Script Restriction.* In each of the following cases, the specified
    sequence must only consist of characters from a single script (after
    ignoring /Common/ and /Inherited/ script characters).
  * *Normalization. *In each of the following cases, the specified
    sequence must be in NFC format. (To test an identifier that is not
    required to be in NFC, first transform into NFC format and then test
    the condition.)

Implementations may also impose tighter restrictions than provided
below, in order to eliminate some other circumstances where the
characters either have no visual effect or the effect has no semantic
importance.

*A1 <#A1>. Allow ZWNJ in the following context:*

*Breaking a cursive connection. * That is, in the context based on the
Joining_Type property, consisting of:

  * A Left-Joining or Dual-Joining character, followed by zero or more
    Transparent characters, followed by a ZWNJ, followed by zero or more
    Transparent characters, followed by a Right-Joining or Dual-Joining
    character

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax): */$LJ $T* ZWNJ $T* $RJ/*

Where the character classes like $T could be defined with Unicode
properties (similar to UnicodeSet notation) like this:

    $T = \p{Joining_Type=Transparent}
    $RJ = [\p{Joining_Type=Dual_Joining}\p{Joining_Type=Right_Joining}]
    $LJ = [\p{Joining_Type=Dual_Joining}\p{Joining_Type=Left_Joining}] 

For example, consider Farsi </Noon, Alef, Meem, Heh, Alef, Farsi Yeh/>.
Without a ZWNJ, it translates to "names", as shown in the first row;
with a ZWNJ between Heh and Alef, it means "a letter", as shown in the
second row of /Figure 1/.

*A2 <#A2>. Allow ZWNJ in the following context:*

*In a conjunct context.* That is, a sequence of the form:

  * A Letter, followed by a Virama, followed by a ZWNJ (optionally
    preceded or followed by certain nonspacing marks), followed by a Letter.

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax): */$L $M* $V $M₁* ZWNJ $M₁* $L/*

Where:

    $L = \p{General_Category=Letter}
    $V = \p{Canonical_Combining_Class=Virama}
    $M = \p{General_Category=Mn}
    $M₁ = [\p{General_Category=Mn}&\p{CCC≠0}] 

For example, the Malayalam word for /eyewitness/ is shown in /Figure 2/.
The form without the ZWNJ in the second row is incorrect in this case.

  * A Letter, followed by a Virama, followed by a ZWJ (optionally
    preceded or followed by certain nonspacing marks), and not followed
    by a character of type Indic_Syllabic_Category=Vowel_Dependent

This corresponds to the following regular expression (in Perl-style
syntax): */$L $M* $V $M₁* ZWJ (?!$D)/*

Where:

    $L= \p{General_Category=Letter}
    $V = \p{Canonical_Combining_Class=Virama}
    $M = \p{General_Category=Mn}
    $M₁ = [\p{General_Category=Mn}&\p{CCC≠0}]
    $D = \p{Indic_Syllabic_Category=Vowel_Dependent} 

For example, the Sinhala word for the country 'Sri Lanka' is shown in
the first row of /Figure 3/, which uses both a space character and a
ZWJ. Removing the space results in the text shown in the second row of /
Figure 3/, which is still legible, but removing the ZWJ completely
modifies the appearance of the 'Sri' cluster and results in the
unacceptable text appearance shown in the third row of /Figure 3/.

    *Note:* The restrictions in A1 <#A1>, A2 <#A2>, and B <#B> are
    similar to the CONTEXTJ rules defined in /Appendix A, Contextual
    Rules Registry/, in /The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized
    Domain Names for Applications (IDNA)/ [IDNA2008 <#IDNA2008>]. 


        3.1.1.2 Limitations <#Limitations>

While the restrictions in A1 <#A1>, A2 <#A2>, and B <#B> greatly limit
visual confusability, they do not prevent it. For example, because Tamil
only uses a Join_Control character in one specific case, most of the
sequences these rules allow in Tamil are, in fact, visually confusable.
Therefore based on their knowledge of the script concerned,
implementations may choose to have tighter restrictions than specified
in /Section 3.1.1.2, Limited Contexts for Joining Controls
<#Limited_Contexts_for_Joining_Controls>/—for example, by explicitly
providing for the exceptional sequence, while otherwise disallowing the
joiner in context.

There are also cases where a joiner preceding a virama makes a visual
distinction in some scripts. It is currently unclear whether this
distinction is important enough in identifiers to warrant retention of a
joiner. For more information, see UTR #36: /Unicode Security
Considerations/ [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

*/Performance./* Parsing identifiers can be a performance-sensitive
task. However, these characters are quite rare in practice, thus the
regular expressions (or equivalent processing) only rarely would need to
be invoked. Thus these tests should not add any significant performance
cost overall.


      3.2 IDN Security Profiles for Identifiers <#IDN_Security_Profiles>

Version 1 of this document defined operations and data that apply to
[IDNA2003 <#IDNA2003>], which has been superseded by [IDNA2008
<#IDNA2008>] and Unicode Technical Standard #46, "Unicode IDNA
Compatibility Processing" [UTS46 <#UTS46>]. The identifier modification
data can be applied to whichever specification of IDNA is being used.
For more information, see the [IDN FAQ <#IDN_FAQ>].

However, implementations can claim conformance to other features of this
document as applied to domain names, such as Restriction Levels
<#Restriction_Level_Detection>.


      3.3 Email Security Profiles for Identifiers
      <#Email_Security_Profiles>

The /SMTP Extension for Internationalized Email/ provides for
specifications of internationalized email addresses [EAI <#EAI>].
However, it does not provide for testing those addresses for security
issues. This section provides an email security profile that may be used
for that. It can be applied for different purposes, such as:

 1. When an email address is registered, flag anything that does not
    meet the profile:
      * Either forbid the registration, or
      * Allow for an appeals process.
 2. When an email address is detected in linkification of plain text:
      * Do not linkify if the identifier does not meet the profile.
 3. When an email address is displayed in incoming email:
      * Flag it as suspicious with a wavy underline, if it does not meet
        the profile.
      * Filter characters from the quoted-string-part to prevent display
        problems.

This profile does not exclude characters from EAI. Instead, it provides
a profile that can be used for registration, linkification, and
notification. The goal is to flag addresses that are structurally
unsound or contain unexpected detritus.

An email address is formed from three main parts. (There are more
elements of an email address, but these are the ones for which Unicode
security is important.) For example:

    "Joey" <joe31834@gmail.com>

      * The *domain-part* is "gmail.com"
      * The *local-part* is "joe31834"
      * The *quoted-string-part* is "Joey"

To meet the requirements of the *Email Security Profiles for
Identifiers* section of this specification, an identifier must satisfy
the following conditions for the specified <restriction level>.


        Domain-Part

The domain-part of an email address must satisfy /Section 3.2, IDN
Security Profiles for Identifiers <#IDN_Security_Profiles>/, and satisfy
the conformance clauses of [UTS46 <#UTS46>].


        Local-Part

The local-part of an email address must satisfy all the following
conditions:

 1. It must be in NFKC format
 2. It must have level = <restriction level> or less, from
    Restriction_Level_Detection <#Restriction_Level_Detection>
 3. It must not have mixed number systems according to
    Mixed_Number_Detection <#Mixed_Number_Detection>
 4. It must satisfy /dot-atom-text/ from RFC 5322 §3.2.3 <https://
    www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.html#section-3.2.3>, where /atext/ is
    extended as follows:

    Where C ≤ U+007F, C is defined as in §3.2.3 <https://www.rfc-
    editor.org/rfc/rfc5322.html#section-3.2.3>. (That is, C ∈ [!#-'*+
    \-/-9=?A-Z\^-~ <https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/list-
    unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B%21%23-%27*%2B%5C-%2F-9%3D%3FA-Z%5C%5E-
    ~%5D&abb=on&g=>]. This list copies what is already in §3.2.3, and
    follows HTML5 <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
    input.html#email-state-(type=email)> for ASCII.)

    Where C > U+007F, both of the following conditions are true:

     1. C has Identifier_Status=Allowed from General Security Profile
        <#General_Security_Profile>
     2. If C is the first character, it must be XID_Start from Default
        Identifier_Syntax <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
        #Default_Identifier_Syntax> in [UAX31 <#UAX31>]

Note that in RFC 5322 §3.2.3 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/
rfc5322.html#section-3.2.3>:

    |dot-atom-text   =   1*atext *("." 1*atext)| 

That is, dots can also occur in the local-part, but not leading,
trailing, or two in a row. In more conventional regex syntax, this would be:

    |dot-atom-text   =   atext+ ("." atext+)* |

Note that bidirectional controls and other format characters are
specifically disallowed in the local-part, according to the above.


        Quoted-String-Part

The quoted-string-part of an email address must satisfy the following
conditions:

 1. It must be in NFC.
 2. It must not contain any stateful bidirectional format characters.
      * That is, no [:bidicontrol:] except for the LRM, RLM, and ALM,
        since the bidirectional controls could influence the ordering of
        characters outside the quotes.
 3. It must not contain more than four nonspacing marks in a row, and no
    sequence of two of the same nonspacing marks.
 4. It may contain mixed scripts, symbols (including emoji), and so on.


        Other Issues

The restrictions above are insufficient to prevent bidirectional-
reordering that could intermix the quoted-string-part with the local-
part or the domain-part in display. To prevent that, implementations
could use bidirectional isolates (or equivalent) around the each of
these parts in display.

Implementations may also want to use other checks, such as for
confusability, or services such as Safe Browsing.

A serious practical issue is that clients do not know what the identity
rules are for any particular email server: that is, when two email
addresses are considered equivalent. For example, are /
mark@macchiato.com/ and /Mark@macchiato.com/ treated the same by the
server? Unfortunately, there is no way to query a server to see what
identity rules it follows. One of the techniques used to deal with this
problem is having whitelists of email providers indicating which of them
are case-insensitive, dot-insensitive, or both.


    4 Confusable Detection <#Confusable_Detection>

The data in [confusables <#confusables>] provide a mechanism for
determining when two strings are visually confusable. The data in these
files may be refined and extended over time. For information on handling
modifications over time, see /Section 2.10.1, Backward Compatibility/ in
Unicode Technical Report #36, "Unicode Security Considerations" [UTR36
<#UTR36>] and the Migration <#Migration> section of this document.

Collection of data for detecting gatekeeper-confusable strings is not
currently a goal for the confusable detection mechanism in this
document. For more information, see /Section 2, Visual Security Issues/
in [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

The data provides a mapping from source characters to their prototypes.
A prototype should be thought of as a sequence of one or more classes of
symbols, where each class has an exemplar character. For example, the
character U+0153 (œ), LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE, has a prototype
consisting of two symbol classes: the one with exemplar character U+006F
(o), and the one with exemplar character U+0065 (e). If an input
character does not have a prototype explicitly defined in the data file,
the prototype is assumed to consist of the class of symbols with the
input character as the exemplar character.

For an input string X, define internalSkeleton <#def-
internalSkeleton>(X) to be the following transformation on the string:

 1. Convert X to NFD format, as described in [UAX15 <#UAX15>].
 2. Remove any characters in X that have the property
    Default_Ignorable_Code_Point.
 3. Concatenate the prototypes for each character in X according to the
    specified data, producing a string of exemplar characters.
 4. Reapply NFD.

For an input string X and a direction 𝑑 ∈ {RTL, LTR, FS}, define
bidiSkeleton(𝑑, X) to be the following transformation on the string:

 1. Reorder the code points in X for display by applying the rules of
    the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [UAX9 <#UAX9>] up to and
    including L2, treating X in isolation; if 𝑑≠FS, apply protocol HL1
    to set the paragraph level to 1 if 𝑑=RTL, and to 0 if 𝑑=LTR; this
    yields the reordered sequence of characters R.
 2. Apply rule L3 of the UBA: move combining marks after their base in
    R; this yields the sequence R′.
 3. Replace any character whose glyph would be mirrored by rule L4 of
    the UBA by the value of its Bidi_Mirroring_Glyph property, yielding R″.
 4. bidiSkeleton(𝑑, X) is then internalSkeleton(R″).

The strings X and Y are defined to be 𝑑-confusable if and only if
bidiSkeleton(𝑑, X) = bidiSkeleton(𝑑, Y). This is abbreviated as X ≒ Y (𝑑).

This mechanism imposes transitivity on the data, so if X ≒ Y (𝑑) and Y ≒
Z (𝑑), then X ≒ Z (𝑑). It is possible to provide a more sophisticated
confusable detection, by providing a metric between given characters,
indicating their "closeness." However, that is computationally much more
expensive, and requires more sophisticated data, so at this point in
time the simpler mechanism has been chosen. That means that in some
cases the test may be overly inclusive.

    *Note:* The operation /internalSkeleton/ may change the Bidi_Class
    of characters, so it does not commute with the reordering and
    mirroring steps, and needs to be performed after them. 

    *Example:* The sequences of code points S₁ and S₂ are LTR-confusable:

        S₁ ≔ "A1<שׂ" = (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, DIGIT ONE, LESS-THAN
        SIGN, HEBREW LETTER SHIN, HEBREW POINT SIN DOT)
        S₂ ≔ "Αשֺ>1" = (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA, HEBREW LETTER SHIN,
        HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV, GREATER-THAN SIGN, DIGIT ONE) 

    Computation of bidiSkeleton(LTR, S₁):

    R₁ = (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, DIGIT ONE, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW
    POINT SIN DOT, HEBREW LETTER SHIN)
    R′₁ = (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, DIGIT ONE, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW
    LETTER SHIN, HEBREW POINT SIN DOT)
    R″₁ = (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A, DIGIT ONE, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW
    LETTER SHIN, HEBREW POINT SIN DOT)
    bidiskeleton(LTR, S₁) = internalSkeleton(R″₁) = (LATIN CAPITAL
    LETTER A, LATIN SMALL LETTER L, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW LETTER SHIN,
    COMBINING DOT ABOVE)

    Computation of bidiSkeleton(LTR, S₂):

    R₂ = (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA, DIGIT ONE, GREATER-THAN SIGN,
    HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV, HEBREW LETTER SHIN)
    R′₂ = (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA, DIGIT ONE, GREATER-THAN SIGN,
    HEBREW LETTER SHIN, HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV)
    R″₂ = (GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ALPHA, DIGIT ONE, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW
    LETTER SHIN, HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV)
    bidiskeleton(LTR, S₂) = internalSkeleton(R″₂) = (LATIN CAPITAL
    LETTER A, LATIN SMALL LETTER L, LESS-THAN SIGN, HEBREW LETTER SHIN,
    COMBINING DOT ABOVE)

    Note that these sequences are not RTL-confusable; indeed in a right-
    to-left paragraph, the strings look distinct:

        S₁ = "A1<שׂ"
        S₂ = "Αשֺ>1" 

LTR, and RTL, and FS confusability should be used when it is
inappropriate to enforce that strings be single-script, or at least
single-directionality; this is the case in programming language
identifiers. See /Section 5.1, Confusability Mitigation Diagnostics/,
in /Unicode Technical Standard #55, Unicode Source Code Handling/ [UTS55
<#UTS55>].

The bidiSkeleton is costlier to compute than the internalSkeleton, as
the bidirectional algorithm must be applied. However, a fast path can be
used: if 𝑑=LTR and X has no characters with bidi classes R or AL,
bidiSkeleton(𝑑, X) = internalSkeleton(X).

Further, if the strings are known not to contain explicit directional
formatting characters (as is the case for UAX31-R1 Default Identifiers
defined in /Unicode Standard Annex #31, Identifiers and Syntax/ [UAX31
<#UAX31>]), the algorithm can be drastically simplified, as the X rules
are trivial, obviating the need for the directional status stack of the
Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm. The highest possible resolved level is
then 2; see /Table 5, Resolving Implicit Levels/, in /Unicode Standard
Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm/ [UAX9 <#UAX9>].

    *Note:* The strings /bidiSkeleton/(𝑑, X) and /bidiSkeleton/(𝑑, Y)
    are */not/* intended for display. Further, they are not stable
    across versions of Unicode, so that they can only be interchanged
    between systems that use the same version of Unicode to compute /
    bidiSkeleton/. If they are stored, they must be recomputed when
    updating the version of Unicode used to compute /bidiSkeleton/. They
    should be thought of as an intermediate processing form, similar to
    a hashcode. The exemplar characters are */not/* guaranteed to be
    identifier characters.

The use of bidirectional confusability with an appropriate direction is
preferable when possible. However, for cases where the direction with
which identifiers will be displayed is unknown, and for compatibility
with earlier definitions of confusability which did not take
bidirectional reordering into account, the operation skeleton <#def-
skeleton> is defined as skeleton(X) = bidiSkeleton(LTR, X). The strings
X and Y are then defined to be confusable <#def-confusable> if and only
if skeleton(X) = skeleton(Y). This is abbreviated as X ≅ Y.

    *Note:* Some implementations of confusable detection outside Unicode
    use different terminology. In particular, in the ICANN Root Zone
    Label Generation Rules [RZLGR5 <#RZLGR5>], the term /variant of X/
    is used for a property similar to /confusable with X/, and the
    term /index variant/ is used for the equivalent of /skeleton/. 

*Definitions*

Confusables are divided into three classes: single-script confusables,
mixed-script confusables, and whole-script confusables, defined below.
All confusables are either a single-script confusable or a mixed-script
confusable, but not both. All whole-script confusables are also mixed-
script confusables.

The definitions of these three classes of confusables depend on the
definitions of /resolved script set/ and /single-script/, which are
provided in /Section 5, Mixed-Script Detection <#Mixed_Script_Detection>/.

X and Y are /single-script confusables <#single_script_confusables>/ if
and only if they are confusable, and their resolved script sets have at
least one element in common.

    Examples: “ǉeto” and “ljeto” in Latin (the Croatian word for
    “summer”), where the first word uses only four codepoints, the first
    of which is U+01C9 (ǉ) LATIN SMALL LETTER LJ.

X and Y are /mixed-script confusables <#mixed_script_confusables>/ if
and only if they are confusable but their resolved script sets have no
elements in common.

    Examples: "paypal" and "pаypаl", where the second word has the
    character U+0430 <https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/
    character.jsp?a=0430> ( а ) CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A.

X and Y are /whole-script confusables <#def_whole_script_confusables>/
if and only if they are /mixed-script confusables,/ and each of them is
a single-script string.

    Example: "scope" in Latin and "ѕсоре" in Cyrillic.

As noted in Section 5, the resolved script set ignores characters with
Script_Extensions {Common} and {Inherited} and augments characters with
CJK scripts with their respective writing systems. Characters with the
Script_Extension property values COMMON or INHERITED are ignored when
testing for differences in script.


      Data File Format

Each line in the data file has the following format: Field 1 is the
source, Field 2 is the target, and Field 3 is obsolete, always
containing the letters “MA” for backwards compatibility. For example:

    0441 ; 0063 ; MA # ( с → c ) CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER ES → LATIN SMALL
    LETTER C #

    2CA5 ; 0063 ; MA # ( ⲥ → c ) COPTIC SMALL LETTER SIMA → LATIN SMALL
    LETTER C # →ϲ→

Everything after the # is a comment and is purely informative. A
asterisk after the comment indicates that the character is not an XID
character [UAX31 <#UAX31>]. The comments provide the character names.

Implementations that use the confusable data do not have to recursively
apply the mappings, because the transforms are idempotent. That is,

/skeleton(skeleton(X)) = skeleton(X)/

If the data was derived via transitivity, there is an extra comment at
the end. For instance, in the above example the derivation was:

 1. ⲥ (U+2CA5 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SIMA)
 2. → ϲ (U+03F2 GREEK LUNATE SIGMA SYMBOL)
 3. → c (U+0063 LATIN SMALL LETTER C)

To reduce security risks, it is advised that identifiers use casefolded
forms, thus eliminating uppercase variants where possible.

The data may change between versions. Even where the data is the same,
the order of lines in the files may change between versions. For more
information, see Migration <#Migration>.

    *Note:* Due to production problems, versions before 7.0 did not
    maintain idempotency in all cases. For more information, see
    Migration <#Migration>.


      4.1 Whole-Script Confusables <#Whole_Script_Confusables>

For some applications, it is useful to determine if a given input string
has any whole-script confusable. For example, the identifier "ѕсоре"
using Cyrillic characters would pass the single-script test described
in /Section 5.2, Restriction-Level Detection
<#Restriction_Level_Detection>/, even though it is likely to be a spoof
attempt.

It is possible to determine whether a single-script string X has a
whole-script confusable:

 1. Consider Q, the set of all strings that are confusable with X.
 2. Remove all strings from Q whose resolved script set intersects with
    the resolved script set of X.
 3. If Q is nonempty and contains any single-script string, return TRUE.
 4. Otherwise, return FALSE.

The logical description above can be used for a reference implementation
for testing, but is not particularly efficient. A production
implementation can be optimized as long as it produces the same results.

Note that the confusables data include a large number of mappings
between Latin and Cyrillic text. For this reason, the above algorithm is
likely to flag a large number of legitimate strings written in Latin or
Cyrillic as potential whole-script confusables. To effectively use
whole-script confusables, it is often useful to determine both whether a
string has a whole-script confusable, and /which/ scripts those whole-
script confusables have.

This information can be used, for example, to distinguish between
reasonable versus suspect whole-script confusables. Consider the Latin-
script domain-name label “circle”. It would be appropriate to have that
in the domain name “circle.com”. It would also be appropriate to have
the Cyrillic confusable “сігсӀе” in the Cyrillic domain name
“сігсӀе.рф”. However, a browser may want to alert the user to possible
spoofs if the Cyrillic “сігсӀе” is used with .com or the Latin “circle”
is used with .рф.

The process of determining suspect usage of whole-script confusables is
more complicated than simply looking at the scripts of the labels in a
domain name. For example, it can be perfectly legitimate to have scripts
in a SLD (second level domain) not be the same as scripts in a TLD (top-
level domain), such as:

  * Cyrillic labels in a domain name with a TLD of .ru or .рф
  * Chinese labels in a domain name with a TLD of .com.au or .com
  * Cyrillic labels /that aren’t confusable/ with Latin with a TLD
    of .com.au or .com

The following high-level algorithm can be used to determine all scripts
that contain a whole-script confusable with a string X:

 1. Consider Q, the set of all strings confusable with X.
 2. Remove all strings from Q whose resolved script set is ∅ or *ALL*
    (that is, keep only single-script strings plus those with characters
    only in Common).
 3. Take the union of the resolved script sets of all strings remaining
    in Q.

As usual, this algorithm is intended only as a definition;
implementations should use an optimized routine that produces the same
result.


      4.2 Mixed-Script Confusables <#Mixed_Script_Confusables>

To determine the existence of a mixed-script confusable, a similar
process could be used:

 1. Consider Q, the set of all strings that are confusable with X.
 2. Remove all strings from Q whose resolved script set intersects with
    the resolved script set of X.
 3. If Q is nonempty, return TRUE.
 4. Otherwise, return FALSE.

The logical description above can be used for a reference implementation
for testing, but is not particularly efficient. A production
implementation can be optimized as long as it produces the same results.

Note that due to the number of mappings provided by the confusables
data, the above algorithm is likely to flag a large number of legitimate
strings as potential mixed-script confusables.


    5 Detection Mechanisms <#Detection_Mechanisms>


      5.1 Mixed-Script Detection <#Mixed_Script_Detection>

The Unicode Standard supplies information that can be used for
determining the script of characters and detecting mixed-script text.
The determination of script is according to the /UAX #24, Unicode Script
Property /[UAX24 <#UAX24>], using data from the Unicode Character
Database [UCD <#UCD>].

Define a character's augmented script set <#def-augmented-script-set> to
be a character's Script_Extensions with the following two modifications.

 1. Entries for the writing systems containing multiple scripts — Hanb
    (Han with Bopomofo), Jpan (Japanese), and Kore (Korean) — are added
    according to the following rules.
     1. If Script_Extensions contains Hani (Han), add Hanb, Jpan, and Kore.
     2. If Script_Extensions contains Hira (Hiragana), add Jpan.
     3. If Script_Extensions contains Kana (Katakana), add Jpan.
     4. If Script_Extensions contains Hang (Hangul), add Kore.
     5. If Script_Extensions contains Bopo (Bopomofo), add Hanb.
 2. Sets containing Zyyy (Common) or Zinh (Inherited) are treated as
    *ALL*, the set of all script values.

The Script_Extensions data is from the Unicode Character Database [UCD
<#UCD>]. For more information on the Script_Extensions property and
Jpan, Kore, and Hanb, see /UAX #24, Unicode Script Property/ [UAX24
<#UAX24>].

Define the resolved script set <#def-resolved-script-set> for a string
to be the intersection of the augmented script sets over all characters
in the string.

A string is defined to be mixed-script <#def-mixed-script> if its
resolved script set is empty and defined to be single-script <#def-
single-script> if its resolved script set is nonempty.

    *Note:* The term “/single/-script string” may be confusing. It means
    that there is /at least one/ script in the resolved script set, not
    that there is /only one/. For example, the string “〆切” is single-
    script, because it has /four/ scripts {Hani, Hanb, Jpan, Kore} in
    its resolved script set.

As well as providing an API to detect whether a string /has/ mixed-
scripts, is also useful to offer an API that returns those scripts. Look
at the examples below.

A set of scripts is defined to cover <#def-cover> a string if the
intersection of that set with the augmented script sets of all
characters in the string is nonempty; in other words, if every character
in the string shares at least one script with the cover set. For
example, {Latn, Cyrl} covers "Сirсlе", the third example in Table 1a
<#Mixed_Script_Examples>.

A cover set is defined to be minimal <#def-minimal> if there is no
smaller cover set. For example, {Hira, Hani} covers "〆切", the seventh
example in Table 1a <#Mixed_Script_Examples>, but it is not minimal,
since {Hira} also covers the string, and {Hira} is smaller than {Hira,
Hani}. Note that minimal cover sets are not unique: a string may have
different minimal cover sets.

Typically an API that returns the scripts in a string will return one of
the minimal cover sets.

For computational efficiency, a set of script sets (SOSS) can be
computed, where the augmented script sets for each character in the
string map to one entry in the SOSS. For example, { {Latn}, {Cyrl} }
would be the SOSS for "Сirсlе". A set of scripts that covers the SOSS
also covers the input string. Likewise, the intersection of all entries
of the SOSS will be the input string's resolved script set.


      5.2 Restriction-Level Detection <#Restriction_Level_Detection>

Restriction Levels 1-5 are defined here for use in implementations.
These place restrictions on the use of identifiers according to the
appropriate /identifier profile/ as specified in /Section 3, Identifier
Characters <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/
#Identifier_Characters>/. The lists of Recommended scripts are taken
from /Table 5, Recommended Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
tr31/#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/ of [UAX31 <#UAX31>]. For more
information on the use of Restriction Levels, see /Section 2.9,
Restriction Levels and Alerts/ in [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

For each of the Restriction Levels 1-6, the identifier must be well-
formed according to whatever general syntactic constraints are in force,
such as the Default Identifier Syntax in [UAX31 <#UAX31>].

In addition, an application may provide an /identifier profile/ such as
the General Security Profile for Identifiers
<#General_Security_Profile>, which restricts the allowed characters
further. For each of the Restriction Levels 1-5, characters in the
string must also be in the /identifier profile/. Where there is no
such /identifier profile/, Levels 5 and 6 are identical.

 1. *ASCII-Only <#ascii_only>*
      * All characters in the string are in the ASCII range.
 2. *Single Script <#single_script>*
      * The string qualifies as ASCII-Only, or
      * The string is single-script <#def-single-script>, according to
        the definition in Section 5.1.
 3. *Highly Restrictive <#highly_restrictive>*
      * The string qualifies as Single Script, or
      * The string is covered <#def-cover> by any of the following sets
        of scripts, according to the definition in Section 5.1:
          o /Latin + Han + Hiragana + Katakana/; or equivalently: Latn +
            Jpan
          o /Latin + Han + Bopomofo/; or equivalently: Latn + Hanb
          o /Latin + Han + Hangul;/ or equivalently: Latn + Kore
 4. *Moderately Restrictive <#moderately_restrictive>*
      * The string qualifies as Highly Restrictive, or
      * The string is covered <#def-cover> by Latin and any one other
        Recommended script, except Cyrillic, Greek
 5. *Minimally Restrictive <#minimally_restrictive>*
      * There are no restrictions on the set of scripts that cover
        <#def-cover> the string.
      * The only restrictions are the identifier well-formedness
        criteria and /identifier profile/, allowing arbitrary mixtures
        of scripts such as Ωmega, Teχ, HλLF-LIFE, Toys-Я-Us.
 6. *Unrestricted <#unrestricted>*
      * There are no restrictions on the script coverage of the string.
      * The only restrictions are the criteria on identifier well-
        formedness. Characters may be outside of the /identifier profile/.
      * This level is primarily for use in detection APIs, providing
        return value indicating that the string does not match any of
        the levels 1-5.

Note that in all levels except ASCII-Only, any character having
Script_Extensions {Common} or {Inherited} are allowed in the identifier,
as long as those characters meet the /identifier profile/ requirements.

These levels can be detected by reusing some of the mechanisms of
Section 5.1. For a given input string, the Restriction Level is
determined by the following logical process:

 1. If the string contains any characters outside of the Identifier
    Profile, return *Unrestricted*.
 2. If no character in the string is above 0x7F, return *ASCII-Only*.
 3. Compute the string's SOSS according to Section 5.1.
 4. If the SOSS is empty or the intersection of all entries in the SOSS
    is nonempty, return *Single Script*.
 5. Remove all the entries from the SOSS that contain Latin.
 6. If any of the following sets cover SOSS, return *Highly Restrictive.*
      * {/Kore/}
      * {/Hanb/}
      * {/Japn/}
 7. If the intersection of all entries in the SOSS contains any single
    *Recommended* script except /Cyrillic/ /or Greek/, return
    *Moderately Restrictive*.
 8. Otherwise, return *Minimally Restrictive*.

The actual implementation of this algorithm can be optimized; as usual,
the specification only depends on the results.


      5.3 Mixed-Number Detection <#Mixed_Number_Detection>

There are three different types of numbers in Unicode. Only numbers with
General_Category = Decimal_Numbers (Nd) should be allowed in
identifiers. However, characters from different decimal number systems
can be easily confused. For example, U+0660 <https://util.unicode.org/
UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0660> ( ٠ ) ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO can be
confused with U+06F0 <https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/
character.jsp?a=06F0> ( ۰ ) EXTENDED ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO, and U+09EA
<https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=09EA> ( ৪ )
BENGALI DIGIT FOUR can be confused with U+0038 <https://
util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=0038> ( 8 ) DIGIT EIGHT.
There are other reasons for disallowing mixed number systems in
identifiers, just as there are for mixing scripts.

For a given input string which does not contain non-decimal numbers, the
logical process of detecting mixed numbers is the following:

For each character in the string:

 1. Find the decimal number value for that character, if any.
 2. Map the value to the unique zero character for that number system.

If there is more than one such zero character, then the string contains
multiple decimal number systems.

The actual implementation of this algorithm can be optimized; as usual,
the specification only depends on the results. The following Java sample
using [ICU <#ICU>] shows how this can be done :

    public UnicodeSet getNumberRepresentatives(String identifier) {
        int cp;
        UnicodeSet numerics = new UnicodeSet();
        for (int i = 0; i < identifier.length(); i += Character.charCount(i)) {
            cp = Character.codePointAt(identifier, i);
            // Store a representative character for each kind of decimal digit
            switch (UCharacter.getType(cp)) {
            case UCharacterCategory.DECIMAL_DIGIT_NUMBER:
                // Just store the zero character as a representative for comparison. 
                // Unicode guarantees it is cp - value.
                numerics.add(cp - UCharacter.getNumericValue(cp));
                break;
            case UCharacterCategory.OTHER_NUMBER:
            case UCharacterCategory.LETTER_NUMBER:
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Should not be in identifiers.");
            }
        } 
        return numerics;
    }
...
    UnicodeSet numerics = getMixedNumbers(String identifier);
    if (numerics.size() > 1) reject(identifier, numerics);


      5.4 Optional Detection <#Optional_Detection>

There are additional enhancements that may be useful in spoof detection,
such as:

 1. Check to see that all the characters are in the sets of exemplar
    characters for at least one language in the Unicode Common Locale
    Data Repository [CLDR <#CLDR>].
 2. Check for unlikely sequences of combining marks:
     1. Forbid sequences of the same nonspacing mark.
     2. Forbid sequences of more than 4 nonspacing marks (gc=Mn or gc=Me).
     3. Forbid sequences of base character + nonspacing mark that look
        the same as or confusingly similar to the base character alone
        (because the nonspacing mark overlays a portion of the base
        character). An example is U+0069 LOWERCASE LETTER I + U+0307
        COMBINING DOT ABOVE.
 3. Add support for detecting two distinct /sequences/ that have
    identical representations. The current data files only handle cases
    where a single code point is confusable with another code point or
    sequence. It does not handle cases like /shri/, as below.

The characters U+0BB6 TAMIL LETTER SHA and U+0BB8 TAMIL LETTER SA are
normally quite distinct. However, they can both be used in the
representation of the Tamil word /shri/. On some very common platforms,
the following sequences result in exactly the same visual appearance:

U+0BB6 	U+0BCD 	U+0BB0 	U+0BC0
SHA 	VIRAMA 	RA 	II
ஶ 	் 	ர 	◌ீ 	

= ஶ்ரீ

 

U+0BB8 	U+0BCD 	U+0BB0 	U+0BC0
SA 	VIRAMA 	RA 	II
ஸ 	் 	ர 	◌ீ 	

= ஸ்ரீ


    6 Development Process <#Development_Process>

As discussed in Unicode Technical Report #36, "Unicode Security
Considerations" [UTR36 <#UTR36>], confusability among characters cannot
be an exact science. There are many factors that make confusability a
matter of degree:

  * Shapes of characters vary greatly among fonts used to represent
    them. The Unicode Standard uses representative glyphs in the code
    charts, but font designers are free to create their own
    glyphs. Because fonts can easily be created using an arbitrary glyph
    to represent any Unicode code point, character confusability with
    arbitrary fonts can never be avoided. For example, one could design
    a font where the ‘a’ looks like a ‘b’ , ‘c’ like a ‘d’, and so on.
  * Writing systems using contextual shaping (such as Arabic and many
    South Asian systems) introduce even more variation in text
    rendering. Characters do not really have an abstract shape in
    isolation and are only rendered as part of cluster of characters
    making words, expressions, and sentences. It is a fairly common
    occurrence to find the same visual text representation corresponding
    to very different logical words that can only be recognized by
    context, if at all.
  * Font style variants such as italics may introduce a confusability
    which does not exist in another style. For example, in the Cyrillic
    script, the U+0442 <https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/
    character.jsp?a=0442> ( т ) CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER TE looks like a
    small caps Latin ‘T’ in normal style, while it looks like a small
    Latin ‘m’ in italic style.

In-script confusability is extremely user-dependent. For example, in the
Latin script, characters with accents or appendices may look similar to
the unadorned characters for some users, especially if they are not
familiar with their meaning in a particular language. However, most
users will have at least a minimum understanding of the range of
characters in their own script, and there are separate mechanisms
available to deal with other scripts, as discussed in [UTR36 <#UTR36>].

As described elsewhere, there are cases where the confusable data may be
different than expected. Sometimes this is because two characters or two
strings may only be confusable in some fonts. In other cases, it is
because of transitivity. For example, the dotless and dotted I are
considered equivalent (ı ↔ i), because they look the same when accents
such as an /acute/ are applied to each. However, for practical
implementation usage, transitivity is sufficiently important that some
oddities are accepted.

The data may be enhanced in future versions of this specification. For
information on handling changes in data over time, see /2.10.1, Backward
Compatibility/ of [UTR36 <#UTR36>].


      6.1 Confusables Data Collection <#Data_Collection>

The confusability data was created by collecting a number of prospective
confusables, examining those confusables according to a set of common
fonts, and processing the result for transitive closure.

The primary goal is to include characters that would be
Identifier_Status=Allowed as in /Table 1, Identifier_Status and
Identifier_Type <#Identifier_Status_and_Type>/. Other characters, such
as NFKC variants, are not a primary focus for data collection. However,
such variants may certainly be included in the data, and may be
submitted using the online forms at [Feedback <#Feedback>].

The prospective confusables were gathered from a number of sources. Erik
van der Poel contributed a list derived from running a program over a
large number of fonts to catch characters that shared identical glyphs
within a font, and Mark Davis did the same more recently for fonts on
Windows and the Macintosh. Volunteers from Google, IBM, Microsoft and
other companies gathered other lists of characters. These included
native speakers for languages with different writing systems. The
Unicode compatibility mappings were also used as a source. The process
of gathering visual confusables is ongoing: the Unicode Consortium
welcomes submission of additional mappings. The complex scripts of South
and Southeast Asia need special attention. The focus is on characters
that have Identifier_Status=Allowed, because they are of most concern.

The fonts used to assess the confusables included those used by the
major operating systems in user interfaces. In addition, the
representative glyphs used in the Unicode Standard were also considered.
Fonts used for the user interface in operating systems are an important
source, because they are the ones that will usually be seen by users in
circumstances where confusability is important, such such as when using
IRIS (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) and their sub-elements
(such as domain names). These fonts have a number of other relevant
characteristics:

  * They rarely changed in updates to operating systems and
    applications; changes brought by system upgrades tend to be gradual
    to avoid usability disruption.
  * Because user interface elements need to be legible at low screen
    resolution (implying a low number of pixels per EM), fonts used in
    these contexts tend to be designed in sans-serif style, which has
    the tendency to increase the possibility of confusables. There are,
    however, some languages such as Chinese where a serif style is in
    common use.
  * Strict bounding box requirements create even more constraints for
    scripts which use relatively large ascenders and descenders. This
    also limits space allocated for accent or tone marks, and can also
    create more opportunities for confusability.

Pairs of prospective confusables were removed if they were always
visually distinct at common sizes, both within and across fonts. The
data was then closed under transitivity, so that if X≅Y and Y≅Z, then
X≅Z. In addition, the data was closed under substring operations, so
that if X≅Y then AXB≅AYB. It was then processed to produce the in-script
and cross-script data, so that a single data table can be used to map an
input string to a resulting /skeleton/.

A skeleton is intended /only/ for internal use for testing confusability
of strings; the resulting text is not suitable for display to users,
because it will appear to be a hodgepodge of different scripts. In
particular, the result of mapping an identifier will not necessary be an
identifier. Thus the confusability mappings can be used to test whether
two identifiers are confusable (if their skeletons are the same), but
should definitely not be used as a "normalization" of identifiers.


      6.2 Identifier Modification Data Collection <#IDMOD_Data_Collection>

The *idmod* data is gathered in the following way. The basic assignments
are derived based on UCD character properties, information in [UAX31
<#UAX31>], and a curated list of exceptions based on information from
various sources, including the core specification of the Unicode
Standard, annotations in the code charts, information regarding CLDR
exemplar characters, and external feedback.

The first condition that matches in the order of the items from top to
bottom in Table 1. Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type
<#Identifier_Status_and_Type> is used, with a few exceptions:

 1. When a character is in /Table 3a, Optional Characters for Medial
    <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Table_Optional_Medial>/ or /
    Table 3b, Optional Characters for Continue <https://www.unicode.org/
    reports/tr31/#Table_Optional_Continue>/ in [UAX31 <#UAX31>], then it
    is given the Identifier_Type=Inclusion, regardless of other properties.
 2. When the Script_Extensions property value for a character contains
    multiple Script property values, the Script used for the derivation
    is the first in the following list:
     1. /Table 5, Recommended Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
        tr31/#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/
     2. /Table 7, Limited Use Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
        tr31/#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/
     3. /Table 4, Excluded Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
        tr31/#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers>/

The script information in /Table 4 <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
tr31/#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers>/, /
Table 5 <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
#Table_Recommended_Scripts>/, and /Table 7 <https://www.unicode.org/
reports/tr31/#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/ is in machine-readable form in
CLDR, as scriptMetadata.txt.


    7 Data Files <#Data_Files>

The following files provide data used to implement the recommendations
in this document. The data may be refined in future versions of this
specification. For more information, see /2.10.1, Backward
Compatibility/ of [UTR36 <#UTR36>]. For illustration, this UTS shows
sample data values, but for the actual data for the current version of
Unicode always refer to the data files.

    /The Unicode Consortium welcomes feedback on additional confusables
    or identifier restrictions. There are online forms at [Feedback
    <#Feedback>] where you can suggest additional characters or
    corrections. /

The files are in https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/ <https://
www.unicode.org/Public/security/>. The directories there contain data
files associated with a given version. The directory for /this/ version is:

    https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/16.0/ <https://
    www.unicode.org/Public/security/16.0/>

The data files for the latest approved version are also in the directory:

    https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest <https://
    www.unicode.org/Public/security/latest>

The format for IdentifierStatus.txt follows the normal conventions for
UCD data files, and is described in the header of that file. All
characters not listed in the file default to
Identifier_Status=Restricted. Thus the file only lists characters with
Identifier_Status=Allowed. For example:

|002D..002E ; Allowed # 1.1 HYPHEN-MINUS..FULL STOP|

The format for IdentifierType.txt follows the normal conventions for UCD
data files, and is described in the header of that file. The value is a
set whose elements are delimited by spaces. This format is identical to
that used for ScriptExtensions.txt. This differs from prior versions
which only listed the strongest reason for exclusion. This new
convention allows the values to be used for more nuanced filtering. For
example, if an implementation wants to allow an Exclusion script, it
could still exclude Obsolete and Not_XID characters in that script. All
characters not listed in the file default to
Identifier_Type=Not_Character. For example:

|2460..24EA ; Technical Not_XID Not_NFKC # 1.1 CIRCLED DIGIT
ONE..CIRCLED DIGIT ZERO|

Both of these files have machine-readable |# @missing| lines for the
default property values, as in many UCD files. For details about this
syntax see /Section 4.2.10, @missing Conventions <https://
www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Missing_Conventions>/ in [UAX44 <#UAX44>].

    Migration <#Migration>

Beginning with version 6.3.0, the version numbering of this document has
been changed to indicate the version of the UCD that the data is based
on. For versions up to and including 6.3.0, the following table shows
the correspondence between the versions of this document and UCD
versions that they were based on.

Table 3. Version Correspondence <#Version_Correspondance>

Version 	Release Date 	Data File Directory 	UCD Version 	UCD Date
Version 1 	2006-08-15 	/Public/security/revision-02/ 	5.1.0 	2008-04
/draft only/ 	2010-04-12 	/Public/security/revision-03/ 	/n/a/ 	/n/a/
Version 2 	2010-08-05 	/Public/security/revision-04/ 	6.0.0 	2010-10
Version 3 	2012-07-23 	/Public/security/revision-05/ 	6.1.0 	2012-01
6.3.0 	2013-11-11 	/Public/security/6.3.0/ 	6.3.0 	2013-09


If an update version of this standard is required between the associated
UCD versions, the version numbering will include an update number in the
3rd field. For example, if a version of this document and its associated
data is needed between UCD 6.3.0 and UCD 7.0.0, then a version 6.3.*1*
could be used.


      Migrating Persistent Data <#Migrating_Persistent_Data>

Implementations must migrate their persistent data stores (such as
database indexes) whenever those implementations update to use the data
files from a new version of this specification.

Stability is never guaranteed between versions, although it is
maintained where feasible. In particular, an updated version of
confusable mapping data may use a mapping for a particular character
that is different from the mapping used for that character in an earlier
version. Thus there may be cases where X → Y in Version N, and X → Z in
Version N+1, where Z may or may not have mapped to Y in Version N. Even
in cases where the logical data has not changed between versions, the
order of lines in the data files may have been changed.

The Identifier_Status does not have stability guarantees (such as “Once
a character is Allowed, it will not become Restricted in future
versions”), because the data is changing over time as we find out more
about character usage. Certain of the Identifier_Type values, such as
Not_XID, are backward compatible but most may change as new data becomes
available. The identifier data may also not appear to be completely
consistent when just viewed from the perspective of script and general
category. For example, it may well be that one character out of a set of
nonspacing marks in a script is Restricted, while others are not. But
that can be just a reflection of the fact that that character is
obsolete and the others are not.

For identifier lookup, the data is aimed more at flagging possibly
questionable characters, thus serving as one factor (among perhaps many,
like using the "Safe Browsing" service) in determining whether the user
should be notified in some way. For registration, flagged characters can
result in a "soft no", that is, require the user to appeal a denial with
more information.

For dealing with characters whose status changes to Restricted,
implementations can use a grandfathering mechanism to maintain backwards
compatibility.

Implementations should therefore have a strategy for migrating their
persistent data stores (such as database indexes) that use any of the
confusable mapping data or other data files.


      Version 13.0 Migration <#Version_13_Migration>

As of Unicode 13.0, the Identifier_Status and Identifier_Type are
consistently written with underbars. This may cause parsers to
malfunction, those that do not follow Unicode conventions for matching
of property names.


      Version 10.0 Migration <#Version_10_Migration>

As of Unicode 10.0, Identifier_Type=Aspirational is now empty; for more
information, see [UAX31 <#UAX31>].


      Version 9.0 Migration <#Version_9_Migration>

There is an important data format change between versions 8.0 and 9.0.
In particular, the xidmodifications.txt file from Version 8.0 has been
split into two files for Version 9.0: IdentifierStatus.txt and
IdentifierType.txt.

Version 9.0 	Version 8.0
Field 1 of IdentifierStatus.txt 	Field 1 of xidmodifications.txt
Field 1 of IdentifierType.txt 	Field 2 of xidmodifications.txt

Multiple values are listed in field 1 of IdentifierType.txt. To convert
to the old format of xidmodifications.txt, use the /last/ value of that
field. For example, the following values would correspond:

File 	Field 	Content
IdentifierType.txt 	1 	|180A ; Limited_Use Exclusion *Not_XID*|
xidmodifications.txt 	2 	|180A ; Restricted ; *Not_XID*|


      Version 8.0 Migration <#Version_8_Migration>

In Version 8.0, the following changes were made to the Identifier_Status
and Identifier_Type:

  * Changed to the standard UCD formatting. For example, /limited-use/
    → /Limited_Use/.
      o Usually this was simply changing the case and hyphen, but /not-
        chars/ changed to /Not_Character/.
  * Aligned the Identifier_Type better with UAX 31 and Unicode properties
      o historic
          + → Exclusion, where from /Table 4, Candidate Characters for
            Exclusion from Identifiers <https://www.unicode.org/reports/
            tr31/
            tr31-23.html#Table_Candidate_Characters_for_Exclusion_from_Identifiers>/,
          + → Obsolete, otherwise
      o limited-use
          + → Limited_Use, where from /Table 7, Limited Use Scripts
            <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
            tr31-23.html#Table_Limited_Use_Scripts>/,
          + → Aspirational, where from /Table 6, Aspirational Use
            Scripts <https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/
            tr31-23.html#Aspirational_Use_Scripts>/ (later incorporated
            into Limited_Use in Version 10.0)
          + → Uncommon-Use, otherwise
      o obsolete
          + → Deprecated, where matching the Unicode property


      Version 7.0 Migration <#Version_7_Migration>

Due to production problems, versions of the confusable mapping tables
before 7.0 did not maintain idempotency in all cases, so updating to
version 8.0 is strongly advised.

Anyone using the skeleton mappings needs to rebuild any persistent uses
of skeletons, such as in database indexes.

The SL, SA, and ML mappings in 7.0 were significantly changed to address
the idempotency problem. However, the tables SL, SA, and ML were still
problematic, and discouraged from use in 7.0. They were thus removed
from version 8.0.

All of the data necessary for an implementation to recreate the removed
tables is available in the remaining data (MA) plus the Unicode
Character Database properties (script, casing, etc.). Such a recreation
would examine each of the equivalence classes from the MA data, and
filter out instances that did not fit the constraints (of script or
casing). For the target character, it would choose the most neutral
character, typically a symbol. However, the reasons for deprecating them
still stand, so it is not recommended that implementations recreate them.

Note also that as the Script_Extensions data is made more complete, it
may cause characters in the whole-script confusables data file to no
longer match. For more information, see /Section 4, Confusable Detection
<#Confusable_Detection>/.
