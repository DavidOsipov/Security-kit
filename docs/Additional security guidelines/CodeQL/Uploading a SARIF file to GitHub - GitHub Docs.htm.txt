  Uploading a SARIF file to GitHub

You can upload SARIF files generated outside GitHub and see code
scanning alerts from third-party tools in your repository.


    Who can use this feature?

Users with *write* access

Code scanning is available for the following repository types:

  * Public repositories on GitHub.com
  * Organization-owned repositories on GitHub Team with GitHub Code
    Security <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-
    github/about-github-advanced-security> enabled

    About SARIF file uploads for code scanning<#about-sarif-file-
    uploads-for-code-scanning>

GitHub creates code scanning alerts in a repository using information
from Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF) files. SARIF
files can be uploaded to a repository using the API or GitHub Actions.
For more information, see Using code scanning with your existing CI
system <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/
integrating-with-code-scanning/using-code-scanning-with-your-existing-
ci-system>.

You can generate SARIF files using many static analysis security testing
tools, including CodeQL. The results must use SARIF version 2.1.0. For
more information, see SARIF support for code scanning <https://
docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-
scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning>.

You can upload the results using GitHub Actions, the code scanning API,
or the CodeQL CLI. The best upload method will depend on how you
generate the SARIF file, for example, if you use:

  * GitHub Actions to run the CodeQL action, there is no further action
    required. The CodeQL action uploads the SARIF file automatically
    when it completes analysis.
  * GitHub Actions to run a SARIF-compatible analysis tool, you could
    update the workflow to include a final step that uploads the results
    (see below).
  * The CodeQL CLI to run code scanning in your CI system, you can use
    the CLI to upload results to GitHub (for more information, see Using
    code scanning with your existing CI system <https://docs.github.com/
    en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/using-
    code-scanning-with-your-existing-ci-system>).
  * A tool that generates results as an artifact outside of your
    repository, you can use the code scanning API to upload the file
    (for more information, see REST API endpoints for code scanning
    <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning#upload-
    an-analysis-as-sarif-data>).

Note

For private and internal repositories, code scanning is available when
GitHub Code Security features are enabled for the repository. If you see
the error |GitHub Code Security or GitHub Advanced Security must be enabled for this repository to use code scanning|, check that GitHub Code Security is enabled. For more information, see
Managing security and analysis settings for your repository <https://
docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-
features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-
analysis-settings-for-your-repository>.


    Uploading a code scanning analysis with GitHub Actions<#uploading-a-
    code-scanning-analysis-with-github-actions>

To use GitHub Actions to upload a third-party SARIF file to a
repository, you'll need a workflow. For more information, see Writing
workflows <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions>.

Your workflow will need to use the |upload-sarif| action, which is part of the |github/codeql-action| repository. It has input parameters that you can use to configure the
upload. The main input parameters you'll use are:

  * |sarif_file|, which configures the file or directory of SARIF files to be
    uploaded. The directory or file path is relative to the root of the
    repository.
  * |category| (optional), which assigns a category for results in the SARIF
    file. This enables you to analyze the same commit in multiple ways
    and review the results using the code scanning views in GitHub. For
    example, you can analyze using multiple tools, and in mono-repos,
    you can analyze different slices of the repository based on the
    subset of changed files.

For more information, see the |upload-sarif| action <https://github.com/github/codeql-action/tree/v3/upload-sarif>.

The |upload-sarif| action can be configured to run when the |push| and |scheduled| event occur. For more information about GitHub Actions events, see
Events that trigger workflows <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-
workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows>.

If your SARIF file doesn't include |partialFingerprints|, the |upload-sarif| action will calculate the |partialFingerprints| field for you and attempt to prevent duplicate alerts. GitHub can only
create |partialFingerprints| when the repository contains both the SARIF file and the source code
used in the static analysis. For more information about preventing
duplicate alerts, see SARIF support for code scanning <https://
docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-
scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#providing-data-to-track-code-
scanning-alerts-across-runs>.

You can check that the SARIF properties have the supported size for
upload and that the file is compatible with code scanning. For more
information, see SARIF support for code scanning <https://
docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-
scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#validating-your-sarif-file>.


      Example workflow for SARIF files generated outside of a
      repository<#example-workflow-for-sarif-files-generated-outside-of-
      a-repository>

You can create a new workflow that uploads SARIF files after you commit
them to your repository. This is useful when the SARIF file is generated
as an artifact outside of your repository.

This example workflow runs anytime commits are pushed to the repository.
The action uses the |partialFingerprints| property to determine if changes have occurred. In addition to running
when commits are pushed, the workflow is scheduled to run once per week.
For more information, see Events that trigger workflows <https://
docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows>.

This workflow uploads the |results.sarif| file located in the root of the repository. For more information about
creating a workflow file, see Writing workflows <https://
docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions>.

Alternatively, you could modify this workflow to upload a directory of
SARIF files. For example, you could place all SARIF files in a directory
in the root of your repository called |sarif-output| and set the action's input parameter |sarif_file| to |sarif-output|. Note that if you upload a directory, each SARIF file must include a
unique |runAutomationDetails.id| to define the category for the results. For more information, see
SARIF support for code scanning <https://docs.github.com/en/code-
security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-
code-scanning#runautomationdetails-object>.

      workflow-that-runs-the-eslint-analysis-tool>

If you generate your third-party SARIF file as part of a continuous
integration (CI) workflow, you can add the |upload-sarif| action as a step after running your CI tests. If you don't already
have a CI workflow, you can create one using a GitHub Actions template.
For more information, see the Quickstart for GitHub Actions <https://
docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart>.

This example workflow runs anytime commits are pushed to the repository.
The action uses the |partialFingerprints| property to determine if changes have occurred. In addition to running
when commits are pushed, the workflow is scheduled to run once per week.
For more information, see Events that trigger workflows <https://
docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows>.

The workflow shows an example of running the ESLint static analysis tool
as a step in a workflow. The |Run ESLint| step runs the ESLint tool and outputs the |results.sarif| file. The workflow then uploads the |results.sarif| file to GitHub using the |upload-sarif| action. For more information about creating a workflow file, see
